## Introduction

**Social Effects on People from Different Cultures**
This research is focused on finding out how a user's social circle might influence his preferences for users from different parts of the world or culture.

#### Previous Work:
An application uses KNN to create an artificial agent that can recommend eating places to a user. Our agent will parse through the user's information with an aim to understand different characteristics about the user. Then based on that we will provide different recommendations to the user. Additionally, through userâ€™s feedback, the agent will evolve its preference model and recommendation function.

To install all packages `cd` to the working directory and run, 

`pip install -e .`

## How to run

1. Clone this repo to your local machine using `git clone <repo link>`

## Graphs

The following graph shows the location of the user, the number of businesses in the area and the predicted businesses.
It takes `time` and `location` restrictions into consideration.

## Performance

Our algorithm gives an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of:

- Without any restrictions on the database: `-`
- With time and location restrictions on the database: `-`

The fact that we already have a restricted database gives us a MAE of `-` but restricting it further changes our MAE value by a factor of `-`. With a deeper dataset our algorithm would give an even better MAE value.
