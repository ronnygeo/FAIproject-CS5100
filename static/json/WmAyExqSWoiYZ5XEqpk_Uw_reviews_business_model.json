    "text": "I had a $25 food voucher and that's enough for 2.  The chips and salsa bar really give great value but getting carried away with a lot of it will guarantee boxed leftovers.  We ended up with a couple of boxes!\n\nWe ordered the steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas.  The food was pretty average.  The cut of beef they used for the fajitas was kinda weird, almost overly tender and would've been better for beef stew.  Enchiladas were what would we expected them to be.  It's hard to mess those up.  \n\nOur server was very upbeat and friendly.  This place is more like 2.783346 stars and I'm pretty sure it'll be my last time there with so many other choices for Mexican food around.",

Although this place is called the Sesame House, you would never know it.  Its inside the Chinatown Plaza mall area where they have a sign outside just saying \"No. 1 Boba\".  \n\nI would say this is probably the second best place I've been next to Tea Planet but the prices are better here.  Not too much of an atmosphere though.  But the fruit is fresh and they do have quite a selection of dried fruits etc.",

Its been KFC for the most part but she wanted to take a shot at fish and chips. We were at the Crown and Anchor not too long so a coworker informed me that RR had the best fish and chips he had ever had so I thought what the heck.\n\nI just picked it up to go but I was kinda surprised how packed the place was.  The menu is insanely unhealthy for the most part.  I hope families w/ kids don't come here too often.  The F&Cs were decent though..just about the same level as Crown and Anchor.  We also got some chicken fingers too which were just ok.  I can't imagine I would come here to eat again but I could see a lot of people enjoying this place.",

    "text": "This is an ABSOLUTE must go to if you are vegetarian.  It was just the drive from the southwest that prevented me from coming here sooner.  \n\nWhat a menu!  So many great sounding choices.  It was hard to narrow entrees down but it had already been decided pre-arrival that the herbal salad was a must order appetizer.  Thanks Lisa R for the raving about it.  What a tasty, crazy mix of stuff.  The #7 spice was a little over the top as it set my tongue ablaze but was a good burn for the wife.  I don't know what happened to my relationship with spicy food but it has cooled off considerably the last few years.  I guess I'm getting old.  I would've ordered a 10 spice a long time ago. \n\nI was worried since we ordered our curries with #7 spice thinking I would need to ask for a fire extinguisher.  I asked the waiter if I could get a 4 or 5 for the Kang-Ped Delight I ordered.  He said \"No problem\" but the only problem was that the server had our curries right behind him!  Thankfully the coconut milk made it taste like a 5.\n\nThe Kang-Ped Delight certainly was all that!  The curry had bamboo shoots, tofu, zucchini, baby corn, straw mushrooms, snow peas, carrots and hot peppers, cooked in red curry sauce with coconut milk.  It was probably the best Thai curry I've had in recent memory.  I added soy chicken for $2 and it made this killer.  The best fake chicken I've ever tasted.  How did they do it?  I can't wait to try their soy duck and shrimp on future visits.",

Both my wife and I were curious if it was just that particular dinner or if Tony Roma's was really that good.  It was definitely the former.  Not a terrible place but not that great either.  I would go with Memphis Championship BBQ any day of the week over this place.",

    "text": "After SO many recommendations of this place from so many locals, we finally went for a late night dinner here.  For no one there at 11pm, I was astonished to see how much meat they were chopping up in the back of the kitchen.  There were 2 huge mountains of shredded chicken and 2 employees were cutting up what looked to be about 100 pounds of red meat.  No one else was in the restaurant!  Anyways..we went for the chicken burrito ($3), carne asada burrito ($4.50) and carne asada nachos ($6).  No rice, beans or cheese in the burritos, just a TON of meat and guac in the carne while the shredded chicken burrito had a couple of carrots.  \n\nAnyways, no point in going to Taco Bell for me!  My wife still prefers Taco Bell over this though.",

    "text": "Worst Chinese food I have ever had by a Chinese owned and run restaurant EVER.  What the hell were their mothers cooking for them when they were kids to think this was passable?     \n\nJenny, Chad, Debra...you're all right.  It was my fault for not looking at any of the reviews until I checked in after picking up my order.  I actually considered bringing this whole bag back for a refund without trying any of it.  \n\nThen the Yelper denial kicked in.  I thought \"Well...Jenny's review was a few months ago and I ordered different stuff so maybe it will be better.\".  Everyone is Chinese here so how bad can it be??  OH BABY IT'S BAD!!! \n\nTheir \"family dinner\" special looked so enticing.  You get 2 entrees with soup, pork fried rice, 2 egg rolls and crab rangoon for $24.99.  That usually means leftovers but it actually meant straight to the garbage can in reality.\n\nHot and sour soup:  I'll give them credit for soup being hot.  1 out of 2!  Nice job.  I am not sure how they managed to make the soup bland and very oily but they did.  \n\nChicken and broccoli: The quality of the chicken was rubbery.  My chihuahuas enjoyed it and gave it 3 out of 5 Yelp stars.  \n\nShrimp and garlic sauce:  When was the last time garlic sauce was red and uber-sweet?  Eff you, chef.  \n\nPork fried rice:  The best of the worst and it still lacked a lot of flavor.  \n\nI was in such disbelief that I actually called them to let them know how bad it all was.  The person I spoke with said they'd save my phone number and I'd get a free entree the next time I order.  HA!  Maybe if I were contemplating suicide!\n\nI would advise all of the reviewers that bestowed 5 Yelp stars to Cheng's Express to avoid Chinese restaurants like KJ's, HK Star and Wendy's Noodle unless you've consulted a neurosurgeon first because your brain would EXPLODE if you ate at any of those spots.",

    "text": "One of the most un-Vegas dining experiences around.  I never thought this kind of place would be in Summerlin of all places!!  The lake atmosphere was certainly the highlight of the experience...what is it with dining in front of a body of water that makes the experience so much better??\n\nMenu was interesting..I wouldn't say it was French but it was decent.  I had the appetizer of the day which was duck with cornmeal, bleu cheese and jalapenos which was a very interesting and unique combo.  My wife got the onion soup which was certainly different.  The broth was the thickest of any onion soup we had seen and the waitress was saying the veal stock they use makes quite a difference in the taste.  Pretty robust but really good..perfect for dipping the bread into.  \n\nWe were in a meat kinda mood so we got the filet and veal which were both great.  Too stuffed for dessert.  Definitely want to try the meat/cheese plates next time..maybe for lunch.  Saving $25 from restaurant.com was awesome too.    \n\nWine store is great..we're not wine connoisseurs at all so just got a bottle that was reaonsably priced.  Great place to getaway from Vegas for a couple of hours.",

    "text": "This ended up being Plan B after the debacle that was \"Bastille Day\" at a restaurant that rhymes with \"Barche Macchus\" when they offered to seat us in a storage room.  I've had this place bookmarked for 3 years and it was finally time, baby!\n\nBob Taylor's Ranch House is a throwback in so many ways from the cowboy decor, to the music and even menu.  Just the entrance itself is photoworthy!  I felt like I was at some roadside restaurant in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Seeing the chef turning all those steaks as the hostess walked us to our table had me salivating big time!\n\nWe got the cajun shrimp appetizer which was just ok.  While the flavor was nice, the shrimp was a little on the small side.  We still ended up soaking up all the sauce with the complimentary \"garlic cheese toast\".  \n\nThe wife got the filet (rare) and I got the bone-in ribeye (medium rare) after much encouragement from our friendly waitress.  The ribeye was a massive 24 oz's of which I was only able to finish half of.  I usually prefer rare steaks but when it comes to the ribeye cut, I prefer it a little more cooked so I can appreciate all the parts of it from the outside char to the tender center and everything in between.  $42.99 for a ribeye seems cheap these days haha.  The filet mignon was very tender with great flavor. \n\nAll entrees come with your choice of soup (it was a not bad lobster bisque) or salad (avoided based on Jade's review of it being IHop-esque) and a side. I got the twice baked potato only because I wanted the cook to work a little instead of paying for a baked potato which requires really no work at all.  My wife got the ranch house potatoes which could only be described as crazy hash browns.  No $12 a la carte sides items like 16 miles away from here!\n\nSomehow got coerced into getting dessert and was brought the biggest slice of chocolate cake I'd ever seen.  I enjoyed all 3 bites I had before shoving that into the third takeout box of the evening.\n\nConsidering how ticked off my wife and I were for things not going as planned that evening, this was a very welcome surprise.  I am a big fan!  Not sure I would go out of my way to make it back here but this would certainly be on the top of my list when I am back around these parts.",

They have a happy hour from 4pm-7pm and 12am to 8am where the drinks are 2 for 1 and all tapas is half price.  I can't think of another place that offers kobe beef hummus can you?\n\nThe pizza wasn't bad but not one of the best in Vegas.  I do like that they offer fat free mozzerella as a choice.  The thin crust pizzas tasted better than the wood fired ones.  They have a TON of different cheeses for pizza including gouda, goat and bulgarian cheese.   \n\nThe atmosphere is nothing to go crazy about...standard small bar but who cares with a menu like this?\n\nI am definitely going back here for late night dinner.",

    "text": "Holy lotsa meat, Batman!  I was looking to try something different in town so Argentinian food sounded damn good.  Had a couple of empanadas for the appetizer which were excellent.  We went for one of their mixed bbq grill plates which included filet mignon, short ribs, strip steak and what was called \"flap meat\" on the menu.  I asked the waitress if she could clarify \"flap meat\" but she was unable to.  All she said was \"It's hard to explain..but it's good!\". Fine..whatever.  I'll take the flap meat.\n\nThe dinner tables are just on the sides of this meat market/deli place so no need to dress up.  A wife beater would be totally acceptable here.  \n\nThe meat was pretty good.  Quite filling with just a small side of Spanish rice although it could've been all the bread we ate when we first sat down.  Its such a weakness of ours!  I have to stop with the damn bread before the main course!  ANYWAYS...good place.  Enough meat for another meal.  We had a box full of it which we plan on using for omlettes and soup.  And the waitress was right!  That was some good flap!",

    "text": "THAT was a fantastic pizza!!! $12 for a large \"Fellini\" topped with sausage, mushrooms, salami, peppers and olives definitely hit the spot.  All the pizzas are done in a pan which made the Fellini taste like a homemade Pizza Hut supreme.  I haven't been to another spot in LV that does it quite like this and it'll be the best reason to come back.\n\nThere were definitely some minuses like the smokiness and I felt like the whole area was lacking sufficient lighting.  So if you're trying to lay low and avoid people that may be looking for you (manhunts, warrants, ex-spouses, Rent A Center)) this place will do the trick....unless they happen to be a Cleveland Browns fan.  I think this is one of two Browns bars in Vegas.  So when are they erecting the Brian Hoyer statue upfront? (Edit: Hoyer tore his ACL a week after this review ending his season) \n\nSpeaking of football, we were there catching the second half of the Monday night game (Broncos vs Raiders) when music started kicking in from the other room.  Their \"Monday Nites Jamming\" was rocking.  The whole room on the other side was packed with people by 8pm partying like it was 1979.  I was impressed.  \n\nThey also offer daily specials like burger and a beer Mondays but it's got to be all about their pizza!!  Half price pizzas all day Saturdays/Sundays and after midnight!",

I guess when you can just buy a whole roasted chicken at the supermarket for $7 or so...its just ridiculous to spend any more for that.  No one remembers the best chicken they ever had anyways.\n\nBUT...most people can remember the best steak.  This was not the best steak I ever had but still pretty good.  I was surprised the 1st review gave it 2 stars but then I looked at what they had ordered (salmon and chicken) and I understand why.  Beef is the specialty here.  Its like someone ordering salmon at Peter Luger's or something.  I had the porterhouse, wife had the filet.  Nice place.  I remember the bread being pretty good too.  I always enjoy the Lake Las Vegas area.  Its such a nice getaway for a day or 2.",

    "text": "This is BY FAR the best buffet I've been to downtown.  The Golden Nugget's buffet is poison.  My wife actually broke out with some crazy rash after eating there. Fremont Casino's \"Paradise\" buffet is more like a paradise for heat lamps although I can't totally hate on that one only for the \"Swingers\" movie factor.  The servers must be sick of patrons ordering the age of enlightenment there.\n\nBack to the subject at hand.  I got a buy one, get one free coupon so this was a great motivator to finally go.  I know the champagne brunch is everyone's highlight but there's no way I'm ever at Fremont that early unless I'm still there from the night before.\n\nMost buffets don't do much as far as atmosphere but I dug the old school vibe.  The place felt very welcoming with how well lit and clean everything looked.  We didn't have lunch that day so we opted for dinner at the senior citizenesque time of 4:30pm.  Lo and behold there was already a line full of seniors but it wasn't a long wait at all.    \n\nIt was T-bone steak night which was fine.  Standard $6 breakfast type t-bones but I tore though two of them so no complaints here!  I was most impressed with the southern/soul food.  Fried chicken, yams and collard greens were all solid.  Everything else ranged between average or a little above but that's amazing compared to most downtown buffet joints.  \n\nIt's hard to pull me away from the Triple 7 Brewery if we're dining around here but I'd be willing to come here again with a coupon.",

It reminds me of so many of the fast food/takeout places in NYC I would end up getting delivery from at 4am.  This place is exactly what I needed even though China Mama is just 2 minutes up the street.  \n\nThe prices are pretty darn cheap.  $6.50 dinner special gets you an entree, egg roll and rice.  My wife and I split the chicken and broccoli and shrimp fried rice.  I generally prefer my fried rice to not be brown but it was fine...can't complain.  I will certainly be back to take advantage of the ridiculously low priced lunch specials.",

It was just chopped chicken breast cooked in a pan which made it more like a fajita style chicken which tasted fine but wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  \n\nThe menu looks good though.

The whole thing was topped off with a nutella, strawberry, banana crepe.  \n\nJosette is quite unique and she welcomes everyone to the place like they're an old friend.  I can see her approach to dining is what brings people back and makes them \"regulars\".  We plan on coming back too.\n\nShe also runs a wine tasting every 3rd Thursday of the month which we will be at 4/17 for sure!",

So my wife and I go and the bartender just puts a $20 in my machine..lets my wife use 2 coupons so she has $20 in free play now.  I also had a buy one get one free entree coupon to top it all off.\n\nMy wife orders the cheeseburger which was just ok but I get the steak dinner which is a pretty sweet deal for all the stuff you get.  This is quality late night drunken food for sure!!  \n\n7 drinks later, I end up hitting quad aces and quad 5's in back to back hands and my wife hits a ten high diamond straight flush on her machine!!  First time either of us had ever hit those high hands in our limited video poker experience.\n\nDrinks were comped for our play, dinner comes out to $9 and we cash out for $100.  Pretty fn great!!!",

Although they only have a few carts rolling around, they have all the basics of dim sum.  Chicken feet, bahtsang (I don't know what to call it in English, I just know the Taiwanese term), various dumplings and things consisting of rice noodle and meat.  Came out to $32 for 2 including tip which was fine by me.  I would like to try dinner here sometime as some of the dishes sound fantastic.  \n\nWe went around 1:30 on a Thurs and we didn't have to wait at all.",

Crazy bastard.  \n\nIts just a roast beef sandwich dressed up in burgers clothing.  Ketchup and roast beef don't taste that great together imo.  Bun was good though.

We've ordered from here a few times and its never been this good.\".  Wife's answer \"You always ordered the cheeseless pizza..I always thought this place was great.\"  Moral of the story blah blah.  You can't go wrong with any pizza here...except for maybe the cheeseless one which is called La Costa or something.",

    "text": "Holy mother of god!!  What an outstanding meal THAT was!!!  Thanks to Susan R for hooking me up w/ the link for $50 off cuz I probably wouldn't have tried this place out if I didn't have it.  \n\nYou could easily spend $100 by yourself.  The guy at the table next to us did by ordering a half bottle of wine, crab cakes, osso buco and the crepes for dessert.  He also inhaled the whole damn thing but that's another story....\n\nHow can you possibly beat homemade pasta???  You can't.  We opted for the pasta sampler for the appetizer which consisted of gnocchi, ravioli and risotto. I've never had gnocchi so tender.\n\nMy wife went with their version of frutti di mare which was amazing and I went with the squid ink pasta w/ clams.  Did I mention how good fresh pasta is???\n\nThe waiter even brought us a couple small desserts on the house which consisted of a small tiramisu and cannoli which was really cool of them.\n\nI guess the only thing that would hold me back from coming back here would be the price.  I'd be interested to see how it is for lunch.  I know we'll go back again before the coupon expires.  This is definitely the best Italian I've had in Vegas.",

    "text": "When in Rome, eat pizza.\n\nIf you're in Buffalo, NY, you must have wings.\n\nWest Tropicana and Jones Blvd??  Chicken fried steak.  \n\nI'll call it CFS from here on out but \"Chicken from Satan\" might be a better acronym.\n\nIt's rare that I get out of bed early enough on a Sunday to check out any of the dizzying array of excellent brunches around Vegas.  So when my first 2 planned spots went to hell, I chose to eat my feelings at the Black Bear Diner.  Anyone that works here will tell you that CFS is the most popular dish.  They were coming out of the kitchen and into the packed dining area like an assembly line.\n\nBeef that is breaded and deep fried like chicken is kind of a mind blowing thing for non-Americans.  I had to repeat how my entr\u00e9e was being prepared to my Japanese wife twice.  It was a lot to wrap her head around and it should!!  According to BlackBearDiner.com, the CFS with hash browns, gigantic biscuit and 2 eggs totals 1580 total calories, 70 grams of fat, 20 grams of saturated fat, 4870 mg of sodium and 170 grams of carbs.  Holy....fucking.....shit.  This is the exact opposite of Crossfit.  CrossFAT!!\n\nFunny how \"comfort food\" always makes me feel like death at the end.  Good thing the urgent care center across the street stays open late.",

    "text": "Why the hell am I totally addicted to this place???  I usually get the 3 piece breast/wing combo but substitute the last wing with another breast.  (notice a trend here??).  I usually get the pinto beans and fresh veggies along with flour tortillas. \n\nIts weird...everyone can remember the best steak they've ever had, perhaps the best sushi but NEVER the best chicken.  Not that I am saying this is the best chicken I've ever had.  It isn't...nothing comes close to my mom's roasted chicken :)\n\nI guess I go here since its so close to my apartment and the fact that it is a bit healthier than standard fast food fare.  Why go to Taco Bell when you got this place?",

So we decided to give this place a shot after having more than a few beverages at the Freakin Frog.\n\nI got the chicken adobo which was very tasty...hard to describe the taste..almost like a garlic kinda gravy but the chicken thigh almost had a turkey quality to it..maybe it was the beer talking but that's what it seemed like and it was damn good.  For $1 extra, I got a beef soup and a bunch of mini egg rolls so the total came to $9.95 for a huge meal.  My wife got an awesome combo platter which included bbq pork, beef, chicken and red snapper (skip the red snapper if you go) which also came w/ rice and egg rolls all for $8.95!!  A steal!!  \n\nThe setup of the place is pretty nice too.  Almost has an islandy/vacation feel to it if the front blinds are down and you're not looking at the cars going by on Jones :P  Super friendly staff that helped/suggested a bunch of different things for us to try too.",

But I don't like the idea of the sushi just SITTING there the whole time getting dry or whatever.  The sushi buffet places that make it to order are definitely a better way to go.  \n\nDon't get me wrong though..I'll still eat these rolls if they're there.  I just think there are better choices out there for sushi buffets like Sushi Hana or even Sushi Factory.\n\nBTW...Penn from Rio's \"Penn and Teller\" dines here for lunch quite often.  I've seen him there at least 4 times and I don't here that often for my takeout box.  You can't miss him.",

    "text": "Love the old school Vegas vibe of this place.  It's like someone could get whacked at anytime here...in a good way!!\n\nWent with the house specialty, osso buco and loved every tender bit of it!  Too bad you can't order extra marrow on the side.  I feel guilty eating veal for about 30 seconds and get over it.  \n\nThe cocktail lounge is awesome.  This would definitely be the place to get a martini.  Too bad for me I go looney after 3 and wanted to remember this meal.  They had a duet cranking out all the oldies which really took you back to a different time in Vegas.  Good stuff.  \n\nI'll still reserve Ferraro's as the best Italian place I've been to in LV but the ambiance and food really make this place one of a kind around here.",

Some roast meat, sausage, a nice yogurt salad along with a couple of shots of grappa which somehow messed me up enough not to drive home.  Dessert was quite good too.  \n\nThere was a band playing that night so it was quite loud and dark but still a fun atmosphere with food that wasn't bad.  I wouldn't come here w/o my Bulgarian friends though as 2 Asians would seriously stick out like a sore thumb here.",

I got the grilled jerk chicken which wasn't jerk at all...just grilled chicken w/ a fruity glaze and some pineapple and mango underneath it.  Tasty but I could never justify paying $16 for it.  My wife got the chicken santiago which was a lot better than mine and probably what I would get if I did do dinner here again.  Its also great that they offer lighter portions so we didn't have to bring anything home in a box as usual.  \n\nThe place was packed!!  I guess this is a pretty popular place?  Drinks were ok and fairly priced.  It would be a great place for happy hour if they had one.  I think doing drinks with multiple appetizers would be the way to go next time.",

    "text": "It was my mom's birthday and she wanted to do the buffet at Caesars but even at 8pm the line was still 90+ minutes.  Bellagio and Wynn also had 60+ minute waits too.  My genius dad proposed dinner at St Mark's Square at Venetian since they enjoyed walking around there the other day.  I made a reservation for both here and Postrio on the way and she chose Canaletto after looking at both menus.\n\nEven though you're in a mall, it's not just any mall that offers surroundings like this.  The dim evening lighting of the square, the music and atmosphere gives you a really decent simulation of Piazza San Marco although my parents said it's much busier here than the actual one.  Having no pigeons around is nice too :P\n\nMost locals would probably consider Canaletto a total tourist trap but I thought it was a lot of fun.  How have I not taken any of our out of town friends or family here before?  Our server was terrific.  He was super friendly, had great knowledge of the menu and made our experience better than I expected.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nWe started with the \"Bruschetta Caldo\".  I liked that the bread was grilled and you could tell the tomatoes were really fresh.   We also had the \"Calamaretti Fritti\" or fried calamari.  It came with surprisingly few tentacles (much to the happiness of some at the table) and the tartar sauce was a big hit compared to the marinara.  The \"Insalata Canaletto\" was pretty basic with greens, cheese, oil and large croutons.\n\nEntrees:\n\nI got the \"Tagliatelle alla Castellana\" which was comprised of \"pasta ribbons tossed with pork tenderloin, bacon, shiitake mushrooms, Grana Padano and\nthyme in brandy-cream sauce\".  It was rich and flavorful.  I could only finish half since we loaded up on bread in the beginning but it was really good and the pasta tasted homemade.  \n\nMy mom got the \"Maiale Kurobuta Ripieno\".  That was an \"herb-stuffed center-cut Kurobuta pork chop wrapped in pancetta, topped with kalamata olives\nand capers; served with roasted Yukon Gold potatoes and saut\u00e9ed organic spinach\".  This was a MONSTER cut of pork that was really delicious.  I would've gnawed on the bone had I not stuffed myself to be honest. \n\nOn a side note, the servers probably go insane with all the customers butchering the names of these dishes!  Try saying \"Petto Di Pollo Al Pepperoncino\" 5 times!  Or even better yet, \"FILETTO DI BRANZINO AL PROSECCO E ZAFFERANO\"?!?!  How do they avoid laughing?\n\nMy wife really liked her veal scaloppine or as the Italians would say \"SCALOPPINE CON FUNGHI E SPECK\".  They were 4 pieces of delicious, boneless pieces with great sauce, portobello mushrooms and some really good grilled polenta.  \n\nMy dad got the house special that night which was a linguine dish with seafood.  I didn't even try his since I was so stuffed with my own but he said he liked it a lot.  \n\nDessert:\n\nOur waiter surprised my mom and brought out a tiramisu with a candle.  It actually ended up being a really great evening despite our initial plans going awry!!  I will certainly take more visitors here.      \n\n\nThis spellcheck should take about a decade.....",

Its a pretty limited menu consisting of $11 prime rib and $5 breakfast plates along with turkey and roast beef sandwiches.  No $5 special.  So call ahead if you're going on a Monday.\n\nAny other day is great though.  I usually like to play blackjack til I get $20 to pay for dinner and drinks for me and the wife!",

The chicken was pretty good..its hard to screw up. The ribs were just OK. Famous Dave's and Dickey's both do em better but they weren't bad at all here.  \n\n$71 after all was said and done so we threw in another $10 to fill in the rest of the tip.  We were full and pretty satisfied.",

    "text": "This place is a 2nd tier steakhouse for Vegas when it really comes down to it.  3.5 stars.\n\nWe had a couple of gift certificates that were about to expire so I ordered something I never would.  The King Cut Prime Rib!  What a MONSTER!!  A tremendous piece of bloody cow.  The couple at the table next to us had a look of horror when it was brought to the table.  It was even better than Lawry's.  Just go easy on the horseradish or you'll be making \"wasabi burning face\" in about 5 minutes like I did.\n\nMy wife got the filet mignon as usual and it was really meh.  Ruth's Chris serves a better filet than Gallagher's.  Sides were fine.  We got sauteed spinach which was nice and buttery along with the 4 cheese mac.\n\nService was fine.  I thought it was funny that the server really went out of his way to let us know off the bat that everything was a la carte.  \n\nAnd even though I gush about the prime rib, I never go to nice steakhouses to eat it.  You can do much better for an average price of $40 a steak elsewhere in town.  Craftsteak, Carnevino, Cut, Stripsteak, Del Frisco, Capital Grille and yes, possibly even Ruth's Chris would all be places I'd rather shell out my own dough to eat at than here.  \n\nBut you know what I'm ordering if there is a next time!",

    "text": "My juvenile friends and I have had a running joke for a couple years regarding famed baseball player George Brett's \"incident\" when leaving Kokomo's after gobbling down a bunch of crab legs.  You can see him tell the story on Youtube.  It might be gross to many but I think it's one of the most hilarious stories ever.  \"A great fucking place\" he says! \n\nSo it was an absolute MUST go when the buddy I joke around the most regarding this story was in Vegas for a weekend.  We didn't plan on having the crab legs for a market price of $75 but we did plan on yucking it up as much as we could.\n\nThis might possibly be the best \"fancy\" restaurant at Mirage.  \"Stack\" doesn't measure up to its sister restaurant, \"Fix\", at Bellagio.  Who wants to pay for $15 fried rice at \"Fin\"?  Samba Steakhouse is like comparing Rocky 5 to Texas de Brazil/Fogo de Chao's Rocky 4.        \n\nSeeing as we could've blown the same amount of money going a la carte as Gordon Ramsay Steak, we all opted for the prix fix menu which was reasonable and a good amount of food for $49.99.  I got the lobster bisque after all the raves from other Yelpers and that was flippin fantastic and definitely worth the additional $5.  Since I was in an upgrade kind of mood, I went with the 14 oz grass fed sirloin for an additional $12.  It was grilled perfectly and went well with multiple martinis.  I got the creme brulee for dessert which I couldn't even finish after stuffing myself silly with the terrific bread baskets (bacon bread mmmmmm) between courses.       \n\nService was excellent and it's the best spot for dining at the Mirage with the whole dome thing up top and plants everywhere.  \n\nCan someone let me know if there's a George Brett sighting there please?\n\nHow is it with so many reviews has there not been a Beach Boys reference?",

They would all say \"You should just get the grill.  Its what we're famous for.\"  We must've heard that from 5 different staff people b4 we ordered.  Funny as it was..I was the only one to go for the grill...cuz that was what they're famous for!  Nothing was very memorable about the place.  It was just ok.  I don't plan on going back.",

    "text": "FINALLY made it here after reading so much about this place.  The wife and I went Xmas eve and it was damn good.\n\nWe started with a seafood sampler dish which consisted of cocktail shrimp (with cocktail sauce, garlic sauce and a creamy hollandaisish sauce),  2 large stone crab claws and the best crab cake we've had in Vegas.\n\nBoth of us went with rare filet, I opted for the warm center and she got the cool center (hardcore..if she could order it raw..she would!).  And the lemon cake we got at the end was delicious but could've been good enough for 4 people!\n\nExcellent service...basically everything good anyone else had to say about the place.   Wonderful!",

    "text": "It has been a few years so it's time for an update!  Del Frisco is still a fantastic steak option and probably the best chain steakhouse I've been to.  The one star off is only because other steak restaurants have raised the bar even higher in Vegas.  \n\nWe dined with a friend that's a regular so the host just brought over several plates of appetizers of his choosing which included crabcakes, shrimp cocktail, fried calamari and onion rings.  All of them were great with the crabcakes being my favorite.  The sauce was boss!!\n\nI got the prime ribeye medium rare and even though it was good, it's just not five stars anymore.  Not when famed NYC butcher Pat LaFrieda is shipping his monster cuts to the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead right up the street.  My wife got the filet mignon rare with the cold center as always.  She was very satisfied with her steak.\n\nSaving room for the lemon cake is an absolute must.  It was the biggest reason why I worked out before coming here!  One slice is good for four people.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I won't be bitching and moaning if someone suggests coming here but I've got to put things in perspective.  This isn't the #1 restaurant in Las Vegas.  I'd say it's a top 10 steak in town.  But when you add the terrific service and nice atmosphere you've still got a solid, solid dinner for an evening.",

    "text": "I definitely have issues doing dinner at an Indian restaurant that does a lunch buffet.  It doesn't make total sense but I usually prefer Origin India just for that reason.  But it was late, we had the craving and my wife had a great experience (lunch buffet) the last time she was here so we gave it a go.  \n\nThe place was still full of people at 9pm so that was a plus.  I was excited to see dosa on the menu but the waiter told me their grill wasn't on and it would take at least 30 minutes to get ready.  Ok. Nevermind.  There's a free mango lassi with a Yelp check in.  He tells us it's only good for one lassi per table.  Fine!\n\nWe unintentionally went vegetarian for the evening.  My wife always gets the saag paneer extra spicy and I went with the matar paneer.  Both dishes were very good.  The peas in my matar paneer were super sweet.  Maybe the sweetest pea I've ever had.  I devoured them.  The naan was pretty good but the aloo paratha wasn't worth the extra $1.50.  \n\nI'll be back to try the lunch buffet but I think I am done with dinner here.  Use the Yelp deal!!",

    "text": "6 years ago when I was a tourist in Vegas, I thought this was the best sushi buffet ever.  I went last week and totally thought it sucked.  Makino, Sushi Factory, Sushi Hana, Sandai...all better than this place.  The buffet was just a vast sea of mediocrity at best.\n\nOne funny story though when I was living in NYC and came here with a friend. We had eaten a ton for lunch and were stuffed to the gills BUT THEN my friend saw they made crepes in the back.  He loves crepes more than almost anything in the world.  SO...he went to the bathroom to puke so he could have some room for crepes!!!  RIDICULOUS!!",

Got an order of the magdoos which were 3 baby eggplants stuffed with walnuts and garlic and those were great too.\n\nI couldn't help but notice other customers dishes as I was waiting for my to go order.

Highlights for us include the spicy smoked wings, the best smoked turkey ever (just ask to get the gravy on the side), baby back and the sweet potato side (the brown sugar on it makes it soooooo good!!).\n\nI wished they had a deeper beer selection like Pabst and Natty light but that's about it.",

    "text": "Outstanding weekend brunch!!  We had been drinking til wee hours and were on the fence about rolling out of bed at noon to do this. I am sure glad we did.  Eating on the outdoor patio is definitely where it's at.  Mandalay Bay still has one of the prettiest pools in town and you can even enjoy the outdoor concerts at night without buying a ticket fyi.\n\nInitial thoughts glancing over the menu was that a group of chefs in a bong circle came up with all of it.  How else does one come up with a \"bacon jalapeno peanut butter and jelly sandwich\"?   That was surprisingly good and definitely hit the hangover spot but probably would've even tasted better at 4:20am for some I reckon.  The \"short rib hash and egg\" was another standout.  I felt like I could actually taste the negra modelo the beef was braised in but it was more likely my lingering beer breath.  I also can't say no to machaca ever and their chilaquiles were something I gladly had thirds of.  \n\nWeekend brunches are getting more extravagent by the week on the strip and so are the prices.  $29.99 for all you can eat plus only $5 more for bottomless mimosas makes me feel like I got an amazing deal.  My only wish was that they ran this until 4pm instead of 2pm.  Gogogogogogo!!",

While the quality of the fish was fine, my gripe was more w/ the service here than anything else.\n\nI ordered a cold bottle of sake and they bring out 2 room temperature bottles stuffed in crushed ice.  Am I supposed to wait an hour before this gets cold?  Sent that shit back.  Waiter seemed surprised I didn't want it!! They should've just told people they were out of it then.  It took 20 minutes for them to bring a mojito over and then they close down the bar so my wife couldn't even get her 2nd one for a $1.  The waiter never stopped to ask if we needed anything as I always had to hail him down as he was walking by.  Lame.  This was the first time in a long time where I tipped less than 10%...I hope most of it went to the sushi chef.",

In fact, I liked some of their other menu items even more than the falafel since I got the vegetarian combo.  The combo came with the spinach pie, hummus, falafel, grape leaves and tabbouleh.  That's a serious meal.  There's no joking around here!! :P\n\nThe spinach pie was the best thing on my plate.  The crisp and crunch of the phyllo dough combined with cheese and seasoned spinach was an unbelievable combo of flavors.  I would order a whole pan of this for takeout.  \n\nAnd how can you beat a free piece of baklava with a Yelp check in?  CAN'T!!",

They do offer a few unique dishes I don't see at any other Indian buffet like their version of lo mein, chaat and 3 kinds of naan and soup.  I just prefer the overall selection a little more at other places.",

We just went with the baguette ($1.40), a cinnamon roll,  and a mixed bag of bagels.  The bagels were just ok but I am spoiled after living in NYC but the first 2 were fantastic.  I guess I am going to have to start running more often!",

Imagine me saying the next passage in a Liam Neeson \"Taken\" kind of voice: \"Sit at the bar.  Look the bartender in the eye. Only order 4 plates for 2 people.  You will be full.  And if your spoon is missing, take off your belt, snap it in half and fold it like a New York City pizza to scoop up the rest of your food.\"\n\nWe got the following:\n\nCharcuterie Plate: calabrian salami, prosciutto, parmigiano-reggiano, danish blue & pepper relish.  This was a pretty substantial amount of cheese and cold cuts.  Great with some wine.  \n\nMini Broiled Crabcakes: (3) chipotle tartar sauce.  These were just OK.  I would've preferred just one large crabcake.  No need for the cracked on the bottom of each piece of crab.  The homemade potato chips were a nice touch.  \n\nChicken Parmigiana Sliders: Nice little fried bits of chicken in a bun.  Can't possible hate on this.    \n\nNova Scotia Lobster BLT Sliders: lobster salad, applewood smoked bacon, oven dried tomatoes, avocado and micro greens.  The best dish we had.  I would order a double of this next time.   \n\nThis would be a clear cut choice for a 5 star happy hour ONLY IF they actually offered a discount on beverages!  Palm, couldn't you even entertain the idea of $2 off a drink?  $13 martinis at 4:30pm seems kinda crazy.",

    "text": "Valentine's day dinner and so thankful they didn't do a lame pre-fix menu for the \"holiday\". The reviews were pretty much solid and really helped with what to order. I honestly had my mind made up before I went into the place :) \n\nStarted with a couple of champagne cocktails at the bar before going upstairs to the main dining area which were great. Then the hostess let us through the elevator door while she shot up the stairs to meet us as soon as our doors opened. We were seated by the wall across from the elevator entrance. While this wasn't the best area...this place isn't really that big so I couldn't be picky for such a busy evening. It turns out it wasn't a big deal since there were that many people coming after us since our reservation was at 8:30. Might be a little annoying during peak hours. \n\nStaff was great. Everyone from the bartenders downstairs to the hostess to the sommelier and servers. All top notch. \n\nAppetizers: \n\nPan-seared foie gras, caramelized apple, five-spice cr\u00e8me anglaise, port wine reduction: This was simply incredible. The apples and creme really gave it a great mix of flavor. I could've had this as an entree!! This dish will be the biggest reason I come back. \n\nBison carpaccio: I thought this was just ok. There would be no way to tell that this was bison vs cow but the presentation was unique and tasted great with the truffle and watercress. \n\nOn a side note...I REALLY wanted the escargot but my wife isn't that big a fan. I also questioned whether 3 appetizers for 2 people seemed excessive. \n\nEntrees: \n\nI had to go with the lamb since so many of the Yelpers said it was the best lamb they'd ever had. Awesome dish. I went with medium rare but I think I should've opted for medium. The cous cous that sucked up all the lamb juice and side of squash were great companions to the lamb itself. \n\nMy wife went with her usual filet mignon. Pretty good but its hard to justify the price with so many great steak places in LV. If Carnevino's filet is a 10..this was a 7 at best. \n\nThank god we ordered the chocolate/strawberry souffle in advance. Otherwise we probably would've been too stuffed to order it after the entrees. So worth it!! \n\nI also liked the cigar lounge.  Comfy chairs with a fireplace really set a nice mood.  Perfect place to finish off your bottle of wine after dinner.   \n\nOverall a solid v-day dinner!",

    "text": "Been on a French kick lately so dinner here was a no brainer.  Decor is awesome.  I like how it's tucked away upstairs from the rest of the resort.  You definitely don't feel like you're in Vegas anymore.  Bouchon could be located somewhere in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.  \n\nFor us, having foie gras at a French restaurant is an absolute must.  The Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard was something we had never eaten before.  Very interesting!  Served up in a glass jar and lined with the fat of it on top and spread on Bouchon's tremendous bread was awesome.  The consistency of the foie gras was more of a cheese spread and a bit more dense than usual.  Having it prepared this way really brought out some \"wow\" flavors.  Am I way out of line for licking the jar after I'm done?\n\nOrdering pate for the other appetizer was just way overkill.  What the hell were we thinking?  We should've gotten the veal appetizer instead.  Too much bread, too many spreads, we couldn't finish.  So we got the pate boxed.  I can't remember the last time we got a take out bag before the entrees!  But they did throw in a fresh baguette in the bag!  YES!!\n\nI see-sawed over entree choices for quite a while.  I would've been fine with some kind of a trio entree sampler but I'm a long way from Applebee's.  My wife got the Steak Diane which they call the \"eye of the ribeye\" and I got the scallops.  The steak was better.  I should've gotten it too!  Nothing wrong with my entree but it wasn't anything amazing.  \n\nAnother course...another take out bag!  They gave us a baguette for this bag too!  Too full for dessert. \n\nI just wish I could make one of these damn Sunday brunches one time.  Sigh.  One day!",

It was as if a salmon mated with a whole block of tofu and voila!  That may sound terrible to some but goddamn!  I've had plenty of sturgeon caviar but never the actual fish.  The fish was truly amazing both for texture and flavor.  \n\nThen there's the veal appetizer.  They slow cook the veal, bread it and THEN pan fry it!  What??  I'll have whatever the chef is smoking please.  Juicy, flavorful and crispy with some great cream sauce.  I would've taken this as an entree.  \n\nWe also got the saffron mussels and pate which were very good but not as good as the top 2.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a very enjoyable Valentine's evening dinner.  We chose this place based on the reviews and the fact we hadn't dined at Bellagio in quite a while.  With so many great eats popping up everywhere on the strip, you almost take for granted such great resorts like this.\n\nI made the reservation about a month beforehand and only had a choice of 5:45 or earlier or 8pm on.  8pm it was.  The really cool decor is what strikes you upon entering along with a single rose given to the wife.  It's classy and cool with some bright colors thrown in.  We didn't get to have a cocktail at the bar as we were seated within seconds of looking at the drink menu.  \n\nService was impeccable and the 5 course dinner was unique and delicious.  The standout dishes included the Santa Barbara sea urchin with king crab.  My wife doesn't even like urchin and she finished it pretty quick.  Foie gras was awesome as expected.  \n\nI took a shot on the \"Ris de Veau\" which I had never had before.  It's essentially veal guts that may or may not have contained the throat, pancreas, heart, belly etc.  I think the majority of it was stomach.  It was interesting to say the least, almost tasted like high-end cow brain.  Glad I tried it but I would go with my wife's terrific beef dish if I could do it again.  I finished it like a good boy :)\n\nThe desserts were very cool.  I'd never seen anything like the chocolate cigar with passion fruit sorbet which came in it's own ashtray.  I posted a pic of it.  My wife went with the sugar sphere with yuzu and raspberry.  That came in a clear hardshell sugar ball filled with the fruit inside.  You simply had to tap the top of the ball for it to crack and enjoy.  They also brought out some extra bite sized sweets and presented my wife with some extra chocolates as we were leaving.  \n\nSo why 4 stars?  I've had better dining experiences in Vegas.  Not just around town but at Bellagio itself.  I would rather do Picasso for the price.  And while the decor was nice, the tables were a bit cramped which didn't make Le Cirque as romantic as it could be.  You were able to listen to everyone else's conversations at all the tables nearby.  One couple two tables down kept going on and on about their kids and how they own 3 doughnut shops in Canada to some couple just trying to enjoy their own company.  Maybe it's just me.",

A FROZEN California Pizza Kitchen pizza was better than this.  Aren't margherita pizzas supposed to have FRESH mozzarella and basil on them??  Horrendous.\n\nI got some kind of a rolled pasta that was supposed to have chicken, applewood smoked bacon along with a ton of other stuff.  It sounded delicious on the menu but it was basically mini ground chicken manicotti.  Frozen gyoza tastes better.  Unreal.  Save your money and go to Battista's instead!!!  Seriously!!",

    "text": "OK.  After reading SO many great reviews for this place, the wife and I finally splurged and came here.  \n\nIt certainly is a great restaurant.  Ambiance, service, food quality, presentation etc had everything that shows it really is a 5 star restaurant.  I am definitely glad I came to experience it once.  We got a nice patio table for the fountain show (4 an hour) which was fun.\n\nBut for me, it felt like a place that would pretty much only be a one time thing.  It wasn't the best food experience of my life but it was excellent.\n  \nI guess I would compare it to having a one night fling with a famous movie star cuz they're a famous movie star.",

    "text": "In my first review of Picasso 6 years ago, I compared dining here to having a one night stand with a celebrity.  \n\nWell who said you can't hook up again when they're back in town???\n\nMy wife and I wanted to celebrate our 6th anniversary with a nice dinner.   It had been a long time since we were last here and it sounded a lot better than going to Red Lobster.  The original plan was to dine indoors and admire all the wonderful, priceless Picasso art displayed around the restaurant since we sat outside last time.  The hostess informed us they had a table open outside and asked if we wanted to check it out before deciding.  The fountain show was going off right then and we gave into the temptation of the patio once again.  Screw art :)  It's one of the best atmospheres to dine in Vegas!  I can't say no!\n\nYou get one of two course choices, there's the prix fixe and the menu d\u00e9gustation.  We ordered one of each with wine pairings and even though the menu hadn't changed very much over the years, it was even more awesome now than before.  I think I appreciate fine dining now more than I did 6 years ago but that could also be due to prescription pills.  \n\nWe're foie gras crazy people so that was one of the many highlights.  The foie gras au torchon is the way my wife prefers it while I love their \"saut\u00e9ed steak of \"A\" foie gras\".  The tenderness, oil and fattyness of it all complimented with figs and pistachios is like having a mouthful of multiple orgasms.\n\nThe pan seared U-10 day boat scallop with potato mousseline and jus de veau is like the most perfect, hand picked scallop.  A pearl!  I try to eat as small a bite as possible to savor it all.  \n\nYou basically can't go wrong with any of it.  Why change the menu when it's pretty much perfect?  This also marks the first time I've gotten through wine courses without leaving totally bombed at the end.  I must be getting more mature :P\n\nService was A++ from beginning to end and they offered us an extra dessert dish to celebrate the occasion.  We had such a great time that we ended up being the last ones in the place!",

    "text": "We decided to use our 2nd free seasonal tasting dinner for 2 here after having such a great dinner at American Fish.  Both owned by Michael Mina and this one was really good too.  Again thanks to our teammates for taking down the Yelpmazing race once again and thanks to Misti and MGM for such an awesome hook up!\n\nAssuming the tasting would be kinda like Fiamma where it would be a set thing...the server informed us that they didn't have a seasonal menu anymore.  So we could pick any 2 tapas, split a Seablue salad, filet mignon and sea bass for entrees and then we would figure out dessert later.  Sounded a-ok to us!!\n\nThe naan that came with red pepper hummus, spicy hummus and a feta dip was a welcome surprise over the traditional bread/butter bowl.  It was really hard to tear ourselves away from it realizing we had to pace ourselves if we didn't want to just box the entrees to go without taking a bite of it.  \n\nIf they're letting us choose the tapas...OFCOURSE we're picking the most expensive ones!!  The prawn cocktail \"a la minute\" was 5 perfect shrimp poached in ocean water on a bed of seaweed and ice.  The poaching gave it a real nice tenderness to the prawns you normally don't get in a cocktail. \n\nNext appetizer was the lobster fritter.  3 kinda corndoggy/kaboby deep fried pieces of lobster with bacon and an upscale mayonnaise type sauce on lettuce.  I could've eaten at least 10 more.  That good.  Really!!\n\nSeablue salad was nice and light.  The serrano ham and radish gave it great flavor.\n\nEntrees were great.  To our surprise, we both preferred the filet mignon over the seabass.  They also gave us 2 sides..crushed potatoes and steamed spinach.  Totally unexpected!\n\nSo...much..food...what's the smallest dessert you have??  Profiteroles...rocky road ice cream in a chocolate crusted nut ball.  WOW!\n\nThe seasonal menus were priced at $49 per person but we ended up getting almost $150 worth.  The entrees still tasted great 2 days later :)\n\nMy only gripe is that this is listed as a \"romantic\" restaurant.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  Too loud, kinda cramped and the music fits group dining over couples.",

My wife still prefers Paris but after going there so many times..I'm just done with it.  This is good eatin right here.  I would put Bellagio 2nd to this.  \n\nBest thing to do is make it a one meal day and show up a bit before 3:30 which is when the lunch goes into dinner.  You will save yourself $15 and they break out all the dinner stuff in a few minutes!!",

Definitely make a reservation..even on a Thursday!\n\nAside from that the food was decent.  The wife went for the lasagna after rave reviews from my 78 year old coworker who said it was the best he'd ever had.  It was ok.  A little too sausagey and I thought lasagna was supposed to have lasagna noodles in it???  I went with the calamari marinara/arrabiata or whatever which was pretty good...but Nora's is better and $5 less.  \n\nPortions are huge here, its nice they offer half sizes but I would still opt for the \"regular\" portions since leftovers (ie 2nd meal) is worth having.    You could easily just split a salad and entree with another person and be full.  \n\nI still prefer Nora's and Battista's over this place but its not bad.  I give it 3.5",

    "text": "Dinner prices are very reasonable.  It's surprising how busy it can be considering the location way back in a plaza with nothing else there.  They offer a multisampler dinner which gives you small portions of 4 or 5 things.  I got the buddah's delight which included a few vegetarian dishes and also included rice and naan for $21 but I didn't like everything that was offered.  I would rather just have one large portion of a dish I really liked for $13 instead.  The saag paneer was incredible.  It's amazing how every restaurant does it differently.  This was more pureed than others.  \n\nI looked at their selection for the lunch buffet and it still looks great.  Look forward to checking it out again.",

    "text": "\"They have mashed potatoes!!!\" exclaimed a child to his grandparents as if it were Christmas morning.  I couldn't help but laugh.  Just a couple of minutes before that, my wife and I had our photo taken with a 5 foot spoon and fork that the resident buffet photographer then tried to sell to us for $25 during dinner. \n\nI had a couple of comps for the \"Buffet of Buffets\" that were about to expire.  Even though we pretty much only do buffets when friends and family visit, we could not let these babies expire without using them.  The line for Paris and Planet Hollywood's buffets were over an hour long when I called so we ended up here.  No line!  No surprise.  \n\nWe were last here 5 years ago and not much has changed.  The most significant thing was that they got rid of their chocolate fountain and now give out bags of cotton candy.  The best things were the crab legs which were larger and tastier than the ones at the Rio we had a day later.  I also liked the carving station and the dessert area so we mainly just filled up on those.  The salad, Mexican and Asian stations were all mixed bags.  I heard the mashed potatoes were great....\n\nA family of 5 sitting next to us were already on dessert and as we were about to leave, the father got up to speak to the manager to complain about the pasta being cold.  He said it ruined their dinner so the manager fully refunded them!  They were already on dessert!!!  So for cheapos looking to take a shot, I guess you have a mark here.",

    "text": "Another prize for Team 7 members of the Yelpmazing race!!\n\n2 free dinners consisting of the seasonal menu course.  I've only been to the one in NYC years ago.  Kinda crazy we've never gone to this one after living here for quite some time.  \n\nMy wife and I just shared everything and it went down like this:\n\nAntipasti:\n\nCaprese w/ Imported Buffalo Mozzarella, Baby Tomatoes, Fresh Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil: \n\nThe creamiest buffalo mozzarella I've EVER had.  It almost had a cream cheese quality to it.  Incredible!\n\nCrispy Calamari, Peperoncini, Zucchini, Fresh Lemon, Parsley:\n\nI really liked how the deep fried all the ingredients (sans lemon) with the calamari.  Gave it a unique flavor..the fried parsley really works.\n\n\nSecondi:\n\nRavioli alla Fiorentina filled with Fresh Ricotta and Spinach, Butter and Sage Sauce:\n\nI'm usually not into cream sauces for pasta but this was excellent.\n\nOrganic Free-Range Chicken, Wild Mushrooms. Fingerling Potatoes, Natural Chicken Jus:\n\nI have a hard time ever justifying paying more than $10 for any chicken dish anywhere but we got this since it came highly recommended by the waiter.  Outstanding!!  I would actually pay $20 for this dish.  And I usually peel the skin off chicken for health reasons but it was a must eat for this dish.  I'm salivating just thinking about the flavor of this dish.   \n\nDolci:\n\nPastry Chef's Dessert Sampler:\n\nI was honestly high from chicken at this point so I don't know exactly what the trio was but one was like a chocolate ice cream bon bon, some kinda flan and tiramisu.  It was truly struggle to finish dessert since we were so stuffed but we managed somehow, some way :)\n\nCouple of glasses of wine and cucumber martinis really put the bow on this dinner.  The regular menu looked incredible and might be back next week!!!",

Glad we came here with a party of 4 and armed with a sweet $75 restaurant.com coupon which threw caution into the wind.  Look at us being all dangerous!  If we were on the fence on a dish, we just ordered it.\n\nWe tried a bunch of different dishes with the standouts including the steak tartar, ceviche, skirt steak and sliders.  My cousin got this ridiculous pineapple dessert which he deemed outstanding.  It certainly looked that way.  \n\nI prefer Fleur de Lys more than this but nothing I can do about it.",

    "text": "It's been a good 2 years since I was last here and that was a sober up sit down post Moon.  But DAMN there are some deals to be found here.  Fremont street prices right on West Flamingo!  \n\n$3.99 for a really large ham steak, hash browns, 2 eggs and 2 big slices of toast is a knockout deal that I will be back for.  They offer this from 10am-10pm.  My brother doesn't dig on swine so he went with the steak for $3 more and finished even quicker than I did.  \n\nWe marveled at some of the new deals they have if you have a Palms players card.  Some standouts included late night specials like AYCE pancakes for $4.99 from 11pm-6am, and AYCE ribs/chicken/cole slaw/corn bread on Wednesday for $9.99.  There would be a line out the door for some of these if Binion's offered them.\n\nYou can check them all out here: http://www.palms.com/dining/las-vegas-247-cafe/\n\nFortunes, the Chinese restaurant, is also there and you can order from both menus.  They also have a bunch of deals.  Granted the food could be awful but I would consider saving up all day for some of these if I were a homeless bum.  \n\nhttp://www.palms.com/dining/las-vegas-fortunes/",

    "text": "There aren't many bang for buck eats at the MGM Grand but the weekday happy hour here is definitely one of them.  I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed everything I've sampled.  They've billed their deal as the \"all night happy hour\" which runs Tuesday-Friday from 5:30pm to close.  \n\nThey have lots of great snacks and finger foods to munch on.  Each of them go for $6 with the duck fat fries being the only one that would fill you up.  The fries are huge and it might be the perfect fry for me.  But it's all about quality over quantity with these dishes.  The beef shortrib sliders have some of the most tender mini slices of meat ever.  I also like the crispy chicken wings a lot and also the beer battered shrimp.  \n\nDrink specials include $3 PBR's because they're trying to keep it real and make Dennis Hopper happy in heaven.  They also offer several cocktails like the \"Whiskey Smash\" with Makers Mark, lime, mint and sugar.  My wife likes the \"Perfect Effen Drop\" which consists of Effen Black Cherry Vodka, fresh sour and creme de cassis whatever the heck that is.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable with the menu and very friendly.  \n\nHappy hour bled into dinner the last time I was here as we imbibed a little more than we probably should have.  The bartender strongly urged I order the \"Harissa Glazed Lamb Shank\" and that was right on the money.  No knife was necessary for this perfect piece of lamb.  It was juicy, tender, almost fall off the bone awesome. It was accompanied with cous cous and raisins.  I could've used some pita and yogurt sauce if they had it.  \n\nThe clear star entree had to be the \"Lobster Pot Pie\" with truffle cream and vegetables.  We didn't have it but couldn't miss a few of the customers getting it.  The server rolls out this baby tableside while everything is still in the pot.  Then they cut the crust from the top and carefully separate the pie from the pot on to a large plate for a unique presentation.  That was $85.  I'll save that one for a different occasion.",

The jazz band was a nice touch and it was great watching people do the sky jump.  Definitely a tourist trap though.  Restaurant.com coupon helped the bill hurt less.  But I'm pretty sure this will be the only/last time I eat here.  Dinner some place else and then the bar here all the way next time.",

    "text": "After two visits in the last six months, I remain totally unaware of their a la carte offerings.  It's like a small bolt of electricity triggers my brain to point at the picture of the AYCE deal (now $25) and tell the server in what feels like slow motion to say \"I'll......have......this.\".  This incurable auto reaction would even prompt me to order AYCE KBBQ if I saw it on Denny's menu. \n\nWith quite a few popular restaurants in this plaza now, Jin Mee feels like a forgotten place.  The space is big and looks like it could easily fit a crowd of 100+.  I wonder if those banquet tables to the rear of the restaurant ever get used anymore. \n\nIt doesn't take a lot for me to enjoy spots like this.  As long as there's pork belly, bulgogi, the other usual offerings and they are of reasonable freshness, I am a happy man.  But there are a few things that make this place a standout.  My wife loooooves the spicy marinated raw crab.  I am not sure if anywhere else offers this but it's pretty awesome.  You gotta get all barbaric with it and just break the shells in your mouth to get those glorious slithers of spicy crab. \n\nThen they bring out a ton of other dishes before the meat comes out.  You get a large plate of salad, a bowl of steamed egg, a hearty tofu soup with beans and potato, and then 8 dishes of banchan.  A very impressive Korean feast indeed!!  I look at it all as a clever trap.  If customers stuff their faces with this, they'll eat less meat.  Everything I mentioned above probably costs them less than $4 in ingredients.  All tasty and worth sampling for sure, but keep your eyes on the prize!  Kind of like the salad bar at Texas de Brazil.  Trap!!!!\n\nThe owner, Chu, was there during my last visit.  He said he was a good golfer and gave me his card saying we should golf sometime.  I hit my friend with a golf ball in the leg after a ridiculous slice 30 feet away the last time I golfed and dutifully informed Chu of this.  He decided to quickly change the subject by offering some grilled shrimp on the house.  That's only on the more expensive AYCE package that includes choices of several kinds of seafood and ribeye.  The shrimp were delicious and unusually sweet.  Nice guy.\n\nThe table grills were decently ventilated meaning I wasn't wearing full on BBQ cologne afterwards.  I am a fan!",

You would never think a place as great as this would be located on Casino and Charleston but it is and I am thankful for that.\n\nMy wife and I split the crab and corn chowder that everyone raves about on Yelp and it was very good.  I am not so into the cream based soups but I enjoyed it.  My wife loved it.  We went with the lobster ravioli and Orange Roughy in lobster curry sauce.  Both entrees were excellent.  I even enjoyed the bread which I think was a pesto/cilantro baked bread.  \n\nAnyways..cool atmosphere, great menu, friendly staff blah blah blah JUST GO.",

It's certainly a 5 star experience if you combine the great view of the strip, service, atmosphere and the walk up to Moon and the Playboy Club afterwards.\n\nI've been able to sample a few of the dishes here and have enjoyed all of them.  The standout appetizers would be the baby octopus, raviolo and calamari.  I had the Sunday Gravy pasta the last time which included braciole, sausage, meatballs and pork gravy.  Heart attack on a plate!  It felt so wrong yet sooooo right.  The Nove spaghetti, pansotti (short ribs, brown butter, hazelnuts, spinach) and veal Nove were also very memorable from past visits.  The dessert menu is decent if you actually have room for it.  \n\nThis would be a great place to take some first timers visiting LV since you could cover a lot they would want to see in one evening.  Just make sure to have dinner a bit later than usual so you can enjoy the festivities upstairs when you're full as a bull.",

    "text": "My out of town buddy wanted Italian somewhere he hadn't been before.  He's a frequent visitor to Vegas so he has been to most of the good ones on the strip (thanks to me! ha!).  Throw in Restaurant Week and a lack of last minute tables available at 9pm on a Saturday and I was back at Rao's for the first time in 6 years.  \n\nI wanted to dine in the Christmas room again but there was a wait so we just opted for the lower floor area facing the pool.  We ordered a plate of antipasto (prosciutto di parma, mild sopresata, marinated artichokes, gaeta olives, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, grana padano, gorgonzola cheese, dressed arugula) to kick things off and that was very good.  Everything was fresh and that was a nice substitute instead of four people getting individual salads.\n\nThe osso bucco was literally calling my name right off the page but I figured I could come back for that any other time of the year.  I decided to take advantage of the great value of Restaurant Week and use the couple of bucks saved on drinking more wine.  \n\nThe appetizer was \"Mozzarella in Carrozza\" which was described as fried fresh mozzarella sandwich served with marinara.  In reality it was 2 HUGE wedges of deep fried breaded mozzarella.  So unhealthy yet so delicious.  Fried cheese has never tasted bad...ever.\n\nThere were four options for the main course but since everyone else was getting pasta (scampi, spaghetti and meatballs, shells) I decided on the pork chop and MAN OH MAN was that a solid choice.  It was a double cut of pork that was pan seared and sauteed with hot and sweet cherry peppers.  It was juicy, spicy, well seasoned and I ended up gnawing on the bones at the end like a dog.  \n\nI took only one bite of the tiramisu since I was so full and my wife ate the rest of it.  \n\nThere are so, so, so many Italian options around these days (and better values to be had) but I wouldn't mind splurging a little more for this gem a few times a year.",

    "text": "Exchanged some of my Amex points for a $100 gift card here.  What a great dinner it was.  As a whole meal from beginning to end...it certainly is better than either Morton's or Ruth's Chris.  I like aspects of both those restaurants but certain things still lack for a complete meal.  \n\nFor ex...we only order steak at Ruth's Chris.  No sides, apps or desserts...cuz they all suck.  But not this place. Fleming's was surprisingly awesome.  The place was also super packed for a random Tuesday night.  \n\nThe bread for example doesn't come with just butter.  You get a feta cheese butter and a sun dried tomato butter.  I got the ribeye and the wife got the usual rare filet which were both fantastic.  Tons of sides to choose from and went with creamed spinach and mac and cheese. Had some special dessert not on the menu which was basically a super version of a Mcdonald's apple pie w/ cranberries and vanilla ice cream.  Fn great.  \n\nThey also have a killer happy hour from 5-7.",

    "text": "We had a little left on a Station Casino gift card and a weluvlocals.com coupon which made this a very reasonably priced dinner for us. \n\nI really like the atmosphere and style of the restaurant itself. The big fireplace on the left side makes it feel cozy, the high ceilings and their outdoor bar is the best place to have a beverage or 7 in all of Red Rock. \n\nI noticed a lot of complaints about the prices in other Yelp reviews. Here are some ways to keep dinner under some kind of budget: \n\n1. Skip the appetizers completely. Let's be honest. There's nothing you haven't had before here. Crab cakes, caprese salad, oysters, shrimp cocktail..zzzzzzzzzzzzz. And there's no way they'll do it better than your favorite place anyways. The bread is good enough here if you're starving. \n\nPlus you're at a freakin steakhouse for chrissakes! I for one always end up getting tons of things boxed up since the portions are so big. Why stuff yourself with pricey and meh things? \n\n2. Go with the Chateaubriand for $99. Its a complete dinner for 2 and it comes with a rainbow of roasted vegetables and potatoes. That means you don't need to pay for $10 side dishes. \n\nOn a side note, it continually blows my mind how any steakhouse charges $10+ for steamed asparagus. Good god! I want them to at least work a little bit on the damn vegetable. Grill it!! Sautee it!! Show me the chef put some elbow grease into it. It's simply wrong on principle alone to spend that much on steamed anything unless it's a whole fish. \n\nLike any real restaurant that serves Chateaubriand, they will cook the beef tenderloin table-side, carve it and plate it in front of you. Its like the soft rock music of steak to teppenyaki's heavy metal. The presentation could also be potentially semi-impressive if you're on a first date. Just throwing that out there. \n\nThe tenderloin itself is good enough and enjoyable. No way can it compare to some other places in town but it still makes for a nice steak dinner. \n\n3. You could also keep it cheap for dessert by going to the Grand Cafe or Ben and Jerry's in the food court. Neither of which we did since we were so stuffed from the entree but there's another suggestion. \n\nI would only come back here for a proper dinner if I had a significant discount. There are too many other cows in the sea.",

My wife and I were in The District for a mid-afternoon walk...not even that hungry but since we only come here maybe once a month I HAD to try this place after reading so many rave reviews.  This didn't disappoint at all.  The reviews lived up to all the expectations and I already can't wait to go back to try all the other pies they have.  \n\nWe just split the margherita w/ half of it topped w/ cured prosciutto and bite after bite was simply heaven.  I hope this place is successful.  Why the hell would anyone go to Metro after having this????",

The spinach souffle was really good...never had anything like that before.  I also liked how they serve foccacia and fries as kind of a complimentary starter as opposed to the loaf of bread/rolls most places do.  Def gonna do mac n cheese next time.",

    "text": "I recently realized that I've had excellent experiences at every Michael Mina restaurant I've been to.  Seablue, Nobhill, American Fish etc.  They're all at least 4 stars and sometimes more.  This past trip to Stripsteak was 4.5 stars.  \n\nI have been here at least 5 times and I always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  This isn't a top 3 steakhouse in Vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  \n\nWe've recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  They'll bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la Peter Luger style and that's what we do.  I also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  To me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  My wife loves the filet so I eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  We like it rare.\n\nThe sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  The spinach souffle is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  I don't think there's any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  The server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  One of my favorite sides ever.  I am over creamed spinach!  We're through!\n\nWe went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  Forget bread, forget appetizers, you've got french fries!  I never make it to dessert anyways.        \n\nBut the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  We had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  The general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  She accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  I didn't make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another WHOLE porterhouse and box it up for us!  I was stunned.  Talk about going above and beyond!  Who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  Wow.  This was an all around great experience and I look forward to the next time.",

The presentation of dishes like the homemade paneer cheese tikka appetizer (stuffed with apricots and raisins, marinated in coriander and basil glazed in Tandoor, pickled red cabbage) looked like something I would get at a French restaurant.  This place isn't the norm and it was just what we were looking for this evening.  \n\nHaving a $25 restaurant.com coupon in hand didn't hurt either.  AND we got a free appetizer just by checking in on Yelp! WEEEEEEEE!!!\n\nWhat an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes!  My wife gets saag paneer at Indian joints like she gets filet mignon at steakhouses like she gets green curry at Thai restaurants.  EVERYTIME.  \n\nI got the Khadi Paneer (House-made Indian cheese and mixed bell pepper cooked in tomato sauce) which was delicious however we were already at maximum paneer overload after the appetizer.  This was out fault for not thinking this through.  It certainly made for a great lunch the next day though!!\n\nThe service was very attentive and filled up our water glasses promptly.  I'll be back!",

Sushi was comparable to Makino but more expensive.  I did enjoy the fact that they has Orion beer (okinawan beer) which is great but pricey.  I'd rather just go to Ichiza any day of the week.",

My wife certainly appreciated the abundance of natto on the menu too.\n\nI kinda felt like the special rolls they made were a bit on the small side.  You'd have to drop at least $40 each to feel full I'd think.  I'd probably lean more towards entrees w/ a couple of handrolls the next time I go.  \n\n3.5 stars but closer to 4 than 3.",

The creamed spinach wasn't good and the sauteed mushrooms/onions was not worth $7. \n\nHad reasonably priced bottles of wine which were fine.

They really bowl you over w/ the whole Italian mafia vibe (Godfather 2 was on the TV) which was way over the top all the way down to the waiters accent but it was freakin great!\n\nI came here w/ my wife and a friend so we split a few things.  We got the caprese salad which was very nicely done.  I liked that they put the bruschetta tomato on top of the whole thing which was a nice touch.  Then we split the rigatoni arrabiata w/ chicken and the lasagna.  All were done very well.",

I would go to The Orleans buffet over this place in a heartbeat.  BUT they do have 1 thing going for them. For some reason, they have the single greatest oatmeal raisin cookie of all time. My wife noted that I may feel this way because the food there is so blah that when I get to  the cookie, it tastes amazing.  Who knows?\n\nI read this article a couple of months ago about George Maloof (owner of The Palms) and how he's so meticulous regarding the details of everything that goes on in this place.  How can he possibly be satisfied with how the buffet is here?  I would rather just shell out a couple of more bucks and go somewhere else.",

    "text": "Of all places to actually update for a third time.  I'm not even big on updating yet I am writing even more about the Bistro f'n Buffet.  You'd think I would spend updates on more high end restaurants but no!  I am pulling the trigger once again on a \"mediocre on its best night\" buffet.\n\nWe always eat here for free and the crab is the only thing worth coming for.  Unbeknownst to us until we sat down was that they DON'T serve crab on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!!  Might as well not even be open then.      \n\nA few things have changed for the better.  They now offer all you can drink beer and wine.  Other additions include Thai curry (3 stars), falafel (2 stars) and salmon (2 stars).  It honestly looks as though a few Palms executives have been spending some time at the M Resort buffet by adding all this.  But if the M Resort is Susan Sarandon, Bistro Buffet is Lesley Ann Warren (although \"Clue\" is one of the most underrated movies in the history of cinema).",

But it just came down to the chicken itself for me.  It just didn't blow me away at all.  I know it'll probably come off as insane but I think KFC has better and more reasonably priced chicken than here.  This also is nothing compared to Roscoe's or other soul food places I've been to.    \n\nDon't get me wrong..it wasn't bad..just average for me.",

Call ahead and make sure Kichi is the chef that night.  Every course is like heaven.  Comes to about $90/per person not including alcohol and would gladly spend that again anytime my friends want a fantastic sushi dinner on the strip.",

If I was with a group, this isn't a bad place to bs and do shots etc.  But the food just isn't great here.  Its just average Mexican imo.  3.5 stars is what I would give this place if I could.",

Then again, I too have been spoiled by Mamoun's in NYC for so long.  \n\nAND they have shawarma on a spit!!  Not some chopped up lamb they put in a pan and call shawarma.  Its the real deal, baby!!  The pita tasted like it was freshly baked. Not 100% sure on that though.\n\nMy only gripe are the prices.  $11 for a falafel and hommus plate seems a bit much but when they're the best one around my area I guess I'll suck it up every once in a while.  I plan on getting the shawarma salad the next time I go.",

    "text": "Wait...so you're saying I can have a huge assed shish kabob dinner with rice and salad for $9 and I will be really, really full and satiated??  SOLD!! Found out about this place through ex-Yelper, Poly, so I had to check it out after her raves about it.  \n\nAlmost every dinner entree is less than $10 except for the kabob combo and the lamb chops and MAN is it a lot of food!  Lunch prices for dinner!  Get double the portion of what you'd pay at most Greek joints!  \n\nI had the kabob sampler for $10.50 which included a huge salad, rice, pita, 2 pieces of chicken kabob (thigh meat), 2 pieces of beef kabob, 1 chicken lula (grilled ground chicken) and a pork chop...not some dinky chop either..like a full meal deal pork chop!  Awesome.  Entree was also accompanied w/ a full grilled tomato and hot pepper which went great w/ everything.   \n\nThe menu is simple.   They just have a photo of what each dish looks like which makes it really friggin easy.  \n\nDecor of the place is just simple and there's a cool outdoor hookah lounge which we didn't partake in this time around since we were starving.  \n\nCan't wait to go back.  We already know what we're ordering the next time.  My wife is having the beef kabob/lula combo and I'm going for the salmon.",

    "text": "I don't really consider myself a regular at any Vegas restaurant but Shish Kabob House (SKH from here on out) would come closest to that for me.  I probably eat here at least 6 times a year.  I only get takeout and have never dined here.    \n\nIt is downright AMAZING that not only have they stayed in business this long but thrived.  When so many restaurants have come and gone since they opened, SKH has been consistently great for 5+ years and there really aren't any other businesses nearby that contribute to their success.  People come to this rinky dink plaza for their delicious food.  That's it.\n\nI love their huge combo platter that's around $15.  You get salad, rice or fries, and just a mountain of meats.  Even though Armenia and Brazil are miles away from each other, I deem this platter (explosion!) THE POOR MAN'S FOGO DE CHAO ow ow ow ow!  You get lamb, steak, chicken and lula all in one box.  Sure it's not AYCE but congratulations to you if you can finish this whole thing in one sitting.  My wife and I split this.  It's also $30 cheaper than Fogo so double boom.\n\n****Review #100 for 2013!!!",

    "text": "To have a 24 hour place readily available to people like this is amazing.  We always end up spending about $100 for 2 (those Hite beers are light, refreshing and easy to blow through) but if you bring 6 people, it only ends up being around $200.  \n\nIts comedic to have a large groups of people eat here cuz even though it seats six, its like a puzzle trying to figure out what food goes where on the table and it actually promotes eating faster since you need clear plates to make space for the mackerel, bibimbap, and that 3rd meat plate you ordered cuz you didn't think 2 was enough but it was.  \n\nAnd to top it all off, you get that nice \"beef cologne\" scent from all the bbq that lasts on your clothes for at least a day.  I've always felt like the aerosol spray market was pigeonholed into just flowery type stuff and it could be big business to sell such scents as \"Korean BBQ\", \"Apple Pie\" and \"Mcdonald's French Fries\".\n\nService was great.  Its interesting in the US that the staff has to grill the beef for you as opposed to places in Korea and Japan.  I guess that's just a health regulation thing making sure some crazy person doesn't eat the whole plate raw or super rare, get sick and then sue the damn place.  \n\nAnyways, I like this place a lot.  The best Korean BBQ I've had in Vegas.  I've never been here before 11pm and I like it that way.",

    "text": "President Obama, \n\nWith all the ridiculous \"National ____ Days\" dedicated to superfluous foods like cheese doodles (March 5th) and stupid specific eats like cherry popsicles (August 26th), it's about time you stepped in and made executive decisions on something that is clearly getting out of hand.  Who the hell is rejoicing over a cheese doodle that isn't still living in their parents basement playing N64?  What if I choose to have a blue flavored popsicle on 8/26?  Will Destiny's Child come out of nowhere and start singing \"No, No, No\"? \n\nOctober 15th is WIDE OPEN.  It's the officially the first day of Florida stone crab season!  I am sure you have sampled these incredible claws at a fancy dinner or two during your tenure as the leader of the free world.  You cannot deny that they are some of the most delicious crustaceans on the planet!\n\nSo in love with these claws I am, here is my proposal:\n\n- 10/15 will be a federal holiday and be known as \"National Stone Crab Day\".  Even for vegetarians.   \n\n- Instead of only celebrating the day with bullshit Facebook posts, I was thinking something more along the lines of New Year's Eve.  There would be fireworks, confetti, and instead of holding a glass of champagne, everyone will have a large crab claw from Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab.  They will bite in it when the clock strikes midnight.  \n\n- I've already drafted letters to several high standing Nevada officials about closing Las Vegas Boulevard that evening to throw a parade that will end at Joe's at Caesars Palace.  Judging by my persuasive and emotionally charged message, I am confident this will be granted.  \n\n- A live televised east coast party at the original one, Joe's Stone Crab, in Miami hosted by Ryan Seacrest with Pitbull as the musical guest.\n\n- The dip for the crab is almost equally as magnificent and should be considered for its own day.  We could go with the extremely catchy phrase: Happy National \"amazing crab dip sauce from Joe's that is pretty much crack sauce and should accompany every single bite of claw meat\" Day!  \n\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhilip T.",

But there was a coupon in the mail for their new \"Hot 'N Juicy\" (the jokes you could start in with are endless!!) burger and we went after some pleading from the wife.\n\nI did read in an article about how the Wendy's executives scoured the country for the top burgers, spent thousands of dollars on research and this is what they considered their best effort after a year of trials.  So I was definitely curious.\n\nWe did drive thru and ate in the car since my wife was wearing a Batgirl costume (Yelp Justice League Pub Crawl on Fremont).  Our coupon was for a free single patty Hot 'N Juicy with the purchase of a small drink and small fries.  The bill appropriately for 2 orders totaled $6.66!\n\nThe verdict: Not bad but not great either.  If you like Wendy's menu, you will most likely enjoy this.  I would prefer a Whopper if I am blowing massive amounts of calories and fat on a fast food joint.",

Yeah yeah its a hole in the wall but what vegetarian/vegan can say no to a menu like this? \n\nAfter going through all the awesome Yelper reviews/recommendations I got a take out order of: \n\nVegetarian pork skin rolls: I probably would've believed these were actually crispy pork skins if no one had told me. Great appetizer that was tasty but light. \n\nVegetarian Black Pepper Beef Steak with Special sauce: This was great. The consistency of the protein was as close to beef as I've had at a vegetarian joint and the sauce was great. \n\nVegetarian Fish Steak with Mixed Vegetables: They shaped the protein like mini filets of sea bass with black skin etc but it was still tofu in the end. Not bad but the \"beef\" was way better. Sauce was sweet which I wasn't so into either. \n\nI'm curious to see how they do shrimp and pork chops so that'll be what we go for next time. We'll certainly be back before Jan end since I am running out of home vegetarian recipes that are satisfying haha.",

    "text": "Haven't been back in over 5 years and the menu is pretty much the same.  The Travelzoo deal they currently offer (pay $80 for $149 worth of food/alcohol) made a revisit a total no brainer.  The restaurant's appearance even looks about the same.  There's lots of red d\u00e9cor and the bigger rooms were curtained off since there were less than 10 tables being used.  \n\nThere's good value to be had at Envy.  Most appetizers were less than $15 and all the entrees include mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed brussel sprouts with bacon.  But when armed with the deal I had, it was all about the $55 \"Grand Seafood Plateau\".  Lobster, prawns, oysters, mussels, clams, king crab legs....is it possible to get high off of seafood?  I think I did!  Everything was super fresh.  The prawns were enormous, lobster was tender, and I really liked the added garlic to the clams.  This would cost at least 30% more on the strip.  \n\nAll the sides we had were excellent.  There was a plethora of lobster in their version of this mac and cheese staple.  This was a highlight of dinner and a ridiculous steal for only $7.  We also had the wild mushroom medley and grilled asparagus.  Our friendly server, Nicki, must have seen several takeout boxes in our future.  \n\nI was least impressed with the steak.  The 12oz bone in filet was 3 stars at best.  Even though $44 was a reasonable price for this type of cut, there are too many great steaks options in LV to say this was any more than passable.  I might not even order steak on my next visit.  \n\nThe staff raved about the \"Envy Signature Sea Bass\" as many Yelpers have so I might give that a shot.  Their \"Grilled Pesto Prawns\" and \"Vegetarian Oven Roasted Stuffed Tomato\" also caught my eye.  Entrees like these would be totally ignored at any other steak restaurant, yet Envy might only really be a \"steakhouse\" in name.  The steaks only take up small bit of their menu while so much of it is non-beef.       \n\nThey would be a clear nominee if there were ever a \"Best of LV\" category for \"Steakhouse for people that don't like steak\".  3.79394278797982938641112493 stars.  Round up!\n\nMenu:\nhttp://www.renaissancelasvegas.com/dining/envy-steakhouse.htm",

Easily the best late night sushi place I've been to in Vegas and I plan on going back soon.  Its closer than \"I Love Sushi\" in Henderson which is my fav so I will just come here when I can't schlep it all the way over there.",

We had to order a pound of shrimp after we ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and a pound of blue crab because neither of us felt remotely full.  Everything tasted great though.  But I will only order the shrimp the next time we come here.  \n\nAs soon as we were leaving, a bunch of poker players (JC Tran, Nam Le, Amnon Fillipi etc) came through the door to eat.  I thought it was interesting that these guys could eat at Picasso every night yet they chose to come here of all the places on a Wednesday night.",

My wife ordered white wine and she brought out red.  I wanted Chang's beer and she brought Singha.  We wanted 2 glasses of water (one with no ice) and she brought just one glass of water with ice.  That took my rating down a star.   \n\nWe split a papaya salad at level 7 out of 10 spice.  It was refreshing and spicy as heck for me.  My wife ordered the green curry with tofu.  She always, always gets green curry.  The tofu was deep fried which complemented the curry very well and frying it makes sense so the tofu stays together in the hot broth.    \n\nI got the country curry with shrimp only because it had the most ingredients listed on the menu.  That had eggplant, mushroom, bamboo shoots, green beans, baby corn, basil, zucchini and a few other things in a red curry base.  I had that at spice level 5 which was a quality burn for me.  Definitely a quality Thai meal at a reasonable price.",

It was all just ok.  There wasn't much flavor on the fish.\n\nWe ordered the tiki bowl which consisted of rum, OJ and ice which was ok along with a planters punch and a mai tai (strong!).  The bill came to a little over a $100 but neither of us were very satisfied by the whole meal.  \n\nI prob will never eat here again with so many other options for Asianesque food in Vegas but this would be a great place to hang out and split a scorpion bowl in summer with a group.",

    "text": "Hadn't hit up a sushi buffet in a while and a friend told me this was her favorite one.  Whenever I go to one of these places, my main goal is eat more than I spend there.  All the menu items, even for the buffet, have prices so I try and order the most expensive ones to make sure I get my money's worth.  So it was $50 for me and the wife along with some drinks came to about $90 including tip.  We ended up eating a little over $100 worth.  I know the prices don't mean anything since its a buffet but it makes me feel better for some reason.  \n\nI am all about the made to order sushi buffets.  No more Makino/Todai crap for me.  This place was great.  The restaurant itself is a bit small but nice.  I also noticed that there were more Japanese people eating here than at any other sushi buffet I've been to in Vegas which must say something for the place.  The fish didn't blow me away but it was all good quality stuff.  Its pretty comparable to Sushi Hana sans toro.",

Same owners as Kaizen Sushi and Red Mango.  \n\nThe food is pretty good and the combo meal specials they have for parties of 2-3 are pretty reasonable.  The wife and I ordered the \"The San\" combo which included a ton of stuff including kimchee pancake, and 3 meats.  We were stuffed beyond belief.  \n\nThe atmosphere and decor are pretty nice although I do have to say that the quality of the food at Mother's Korean BBQ is still a bit better than this place.  Still a solid choice for late night food but not the best.  The service was also quite good although we were the only ones eating at 11pm when we were there!",

The Chicago pizza shack vibe was great with their wall of fame and all that although I wondered why there wasn't a pic of Harry Caray..maybe not appetizing to look at?\n\n***Just a note to newcomers here...it takes about 45 minutes for them to make their stuffed pizza so you might want to call ahead of time before you go.  We will definitely do that next time.   The pizza was delicious.  We got a small pepperoni and mushroom and were only able to eat 2 slices a piece.  Had a whole half pie left over!!  \n\nI'm always into checking out what everyone else is ordering.  Seemed like the thin crust was the most popular.  All of the pastas dishes looked huge and awesome so it would be fun to bring a group here next time to sample a few things.",

I've been back to Formosa twice but the last time was around 13 years ago so I was all over this place when I found out they had \"stinky tofu\"!!\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinky_tofu\n\nIt wasn't as stinky as I had hoped but you def got a lot of it for $4 or so.  We also ordered the beef noodle soup, squid stew with noodles and the shrimp pancake.  All were pretty decent.  The boba teas were pretty good too..tons of boba, not much ice.  I like that its open til 2:30am too.",

My wife and I went for our first wedding anniversary after such great reviews of this place and it was right on the $.  \n\nWe couldn't believe the nice place we walked into on that side of Sahara but it's like you're transported into a different place where no one is in a rush..a meal is a MEAL and it's first class all the way.  Our eccentric waiter, Keifer, was funny and entertaining although I am not sure how anyone remembers the specials of the day after 1 listen...so many to choose from!!\n\nMy wife and I both agreed the French onion soup was the best we've ever had!!  I never actually thought it could ever be this good!  We went with the specials for entrees.  I got the fruit de mare which consisted of pasta with shrimp, scallops and a lobster tail with lobster cognac sauce over the whole thing...unreal....and $29 to boot which isn't bad at all!!  My wife went with the veal and that was incredible.  Best veal ever.  \n\nWe also pre-ordered the amazing baked souffle and they also gave us a nice extra dessert for our 1st anniversary.  \n\nAll in all just a wonderful way to eat with the one you love.  Keifer suggested we come back for our 2nd anniversary but I honestly think we won't be able to wait a whole year to come back!!!",

    "text": "Went here with a group of 4 after talking the party out of waiting in line for the Carnival World Buffet on a Friday night.  \n\nThere aren't that many solid choices for dinner at the Rio which also houses the most expensive Indian restaurant in the history of the world, some seriously overpriced Italian, mediocre steaks at a high altitude and a Whopper bar.  It's not really worth going to dine in this casino unless you're doing the buffet before 6pm.   \n\nBUT if you HAVE to do a sit down dinner...this is the place!  Think of it as a wee bit pricier cousin of McCormick and Schmick's.  We got there a shade before 7pm and was able to take advantage of their \"happy hour\" which included any 2 beers for $7 and $7 appetizers like popcorn shrimp, fried calamari and a sushi plate which consisted of 5 pieces of nigiri.  Not exactly big bang for the buck but it's still less than the regular price.    \n\nThey have wide selection of fish prepared numerous ways.  It actually took us a while to finally pick our entrees.  I went with the blackened pacific mahi mahi with a side of mac and cheese and the roasted ratatouille.  My wife got the wasabi crusted ahi tuna.  Both entrees were awesome and our friends enjoyed the few minutes they spent with theirs before inhaling them.  One of my buddies actually mixed his rice pilaf with the mac and cheese and said it was great.  Weirdo. \n\nIt's true from past reviews that the portions of fish could definitely be bigger for the price.  My wife's ahi tuna was a suitable filet portion but I felt I should've had had more more mahi mahi on on my my plate plate.  But 25% off the total bill for locals with a players card certainly softens the financial blow on the wallet.  \n\nThe service was fine overall and the staff had great knowledge of the menu and were able to narrow down choices for us.  Lots of guests got seafood pasta dishes and they all looked great.  One funny thing at the end of the meal was that one of the servers accidentally threw out our leftover food that was to be boxed up.  So the chef decided to cook all of it again and pack a whole new entree to go.\n\nAlso check the chalkboard in their open kitchen of entree and drink specials.  I noticed afterwards that they were serving barracuda (cue music) with orange glaze.  I would've given that a shot had I known.",

I did last week and I'm still kinda surprised about it.  \n\nWhile all the food we had was above average, the portions weren't that big and the prices they charged for some of the stuff was kinda crazy.  $8 for the grilled vegetables which consisted of just some grilled squash and zucchini and balsamic portobello.  \n\nMy wife got a 1/2 rack of ribs and coleslaw for $17 and I got the beef sampler since they didn't have any chicken.  NO CHICKEN!!  At a bbq restraurant!!  My plate consisted of tri tips, st louis ribs (baby back are way better) and brisket which was very good.  \n\nMy wife wasn't even full.  She's 87 lbs and is usually full after a burger but these ribs just didn't do it.  Crazy.  She can be full for $1.85 but not $17?!?!\n\nWe also felt like there was kind of a fast food atmosphere to the whole place.  I could've been at Aloha Kitchen for all I knew.\n\nAnyways...I'd go to Memphis any day of the week compared to this place.  Maybe I should call ahead next time to see if chicken is available b4 I go.",

    "text": "Teppanyaki is ALWAYS a fun time.  Can't beat food, drinks, entertainment and FIRE!  \n\nWe made an 8:30pm reservation less than an hour before and were seated at a full table.  My wife got the filet mignon/shrimp combo.  I got the NY strip/salmon combo.  The fried rice is $3.50 and well worth it.  We were also served a bevy of vegetables including zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bean sprouts all cooked to perfection.  I actually preferred the sirloin over filet here since they chop it up and put a lot of sauce on it.  We were also able to try a portion of the scallops due to a wrong order and those were really good too.  \n\nI get Misti Y's \"shabby\" comment regarding the interior.  The teppanyaki area felt kind of basementy but you kind of forget about it once the chef starts.  The bar area seemed pretty makeshift too.  It wasn't exactly an area you'd spend an hour at.  \n\nOn a side note, maybe it's me being a snob but I scoff at people that order well done steaks.  I know it's a personal choice that I should respect but why would you want to do that to a steak?  No less than 4 people at our table ordered well done!  Their raw cuts of filet looked quite different than the others that ordered rare or medium rare.  Lower quality perhaps?  3 people also straight up didn't want any vegetables even in their fried rice.  Grown people!  More for the rest of us!!",

    "text": "We enjoyed a relatively late new year's eve dinner (10:00pm).  The top reasons I made reservations for Morels a couple of weeks before were:\n\n1. Proximity to the strip.  It's right by the Palazzo entrance.  Easy for us to run out and see the fireworks in 30 seconds.   \n\n2.  They were serving the a la carte menu unlike a lot of other restaurants that night doing some $250+ per person prix fixe bs.  I'd rather just do the full meal deal at Joel Robuchon instead paying that kind of money for overpriced NYE menus at Comme Ca, Koi or holy crap god forbid Sugar Factory.  \n\n3.  STEAK\n\nOur starters were the \"Onion Soup Gratinee\" and the \"Pan Seared French Rougie Foie Gras\".  The soup was a 3 out of 5.  We prefer our onion soups a little more robust and wine flavored where this was kind of sweet.  It was a hearty portion as it should be for $10 but not worth ordering again.  \n\nThe foie gras on the other hand was deeeeeelicious.  It was accompanied by caramelized red onion, candied apples and balsamic reduction.  There's just something about the fatty and unique flavor of the duck liver with fruit that I can't get enough of.  Restaurants in Vegas like Andre's and Gordon Ramsay Steak do it really well and this was right up there.  \n\nFor the entree, we chose not to mess around and just went with the 32 oz porterhouse for two prepared rare.  They served it tableside and it came with roasted rosemary potatoes, fricassee of baby turnips, sauce Bordelaise, onions & carrots.  We asked to keep the bone as always either in hopes of being ambitious a few days later and using it to make beef noodle soup at home or just gnawing at the bone while walking down the street like a couple of insane canines later in the evening.\n\nThe steak was very good.  32 oz is a monster cut and we were only able to finish half and box the rest.  I actually preferred the sirloin side over the filet this time around which was kind of surprising for me.\n\nAll in all a very solid choice for steak but still not close to the best steaks in their own building thanks to Mr. Batali and Mr. Puck.  I would come back here for happy hour and also when it's warmer to dine outdoors.",

Everything was great and the prices weren't so ridiculous...about what I thought I would pay and they also gave us a 15% locals discount!  On a Sunday night!!  Awesome.  \n\nStarted w/ the steak tartare...my wife and I loved it.  We've been to some places w/ great tartare like Craftsteak but this was done in a really unique way.  Whatever olive oil they used to mix is really brought out the flavor in the whole thing.  Each bite was great and I could've eaten that as an entree.\n\nWe decided to split a small pasta course and got the ricotta and egg ravioli w/ some brown butter sauce on top.  $21...for one ravioli!!  But it was one damn good ravioli..perhaps the best I've ever had...maybe I just tried to convince myself of this due to the obscene price though...\n\nMy wife is a filet mignon woman all the way and if that's what she wants for V-day..that's what she's gonna get.  Even though I was dying for the ribeye for 2.  I was thinking how wrong it would've been had I just ordered a ribeye for 2 for myself.  What a pig I would've been hahaha.  Most tables around us got it and it looked so friggin good.  I also got the filet since I'm not into paying a lot for NY strip.  \n\nThe filet was incredible.  I'm not sure how this steak was prepped or aged or whatever but it was very clear that the quality was very high.  There was a unique kind of tenderness to the filet unlike any other I've had.  \n\nI'm going back and I'm getting the ribeye for 2 next time.  No question about it.",

I usually go with the ribeye.  Sure it's more than the usual steak but no one should be coming here to pinch pennies.  Which leads to my next suggestion...\n\n- Don't be a cheap ass.  Outback is at Casino Royale next door.  There's nothing wrong with being frugal but your experience won't be good if you're trying to do it here.  \n\n- The sauces are a waste of time.  You don't need it if the steak is awesome.  \n\n- The filet mignon quality has changed since they opened and I don't think it's worth ordering anymore.\n\n- Think of the pasta as an appetizer to share among friends or just a pricier side dish.  They are not dinner entree portions and don't bother ordering it if that's your plan.  B&B is just on the other side at Venetian and you'd have a better experience there.  That being said, I REALLY like the Ricotta and Egg Raviolo with brown butter and get it almost every time I go.  The Spago is excellent as well.  \n\n- What's even better than great meat for an entree?  Great meat for an appetizer!!  The PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA 'RISERVA' is heavenly.  One order is good for 4.  \n\n- This isn't a very romantic spot.  The music is mostly rockin and the tables are positioned a little weird with that middle section making you feel like you're dining in a hallway. \n\nGod bless Mario Batali!!",

My wife likes Cafe Rio a lot too.\n\nThey're famous for their sweet bbq pork which would've been great..in a barbecue sandwich! The sweetness was too much and really weird in a burrito, even weirder in the salad my wife got.  I would just go with the fire grilled steak or chicken if I could do it all over.\n\nI also disliked how they wouldn't put guacamole in the actual burrito itself.  I was given a teeny, weeny scoop of The Incredible Hulk TV series colored avocado on the side.  That was gross.  Mexicant, Mexidont, Mexiwont.\n\nA couple of things save Cafe Rio from 1 star and that's the quality of the tortillas and the drink station.  Their fresh tortillas could possibly be the best by a Mexican fast food chain and the biggest reason I may give it another shot.  The drink station is bigger than the usual and includes horchata, limeade and various teas.",

Mamoun's Falafel in NYC is my favorite restaurant of all time and while it wasn't close to being THAT good, this is the best I've had in Vegas.  Hummus was awesome and I could eat the pita for DAYS.  \n\nVery friendly staff that gave us a couple of extra pieces of pita for our sampler and the salad was very good with a nice variety of stuff.  Came out to about $16 for two.  \n\nI still don't get how restaurants in Vegas can get away with calling their meat \"shawarma\" when its cooked in a pan.  It should be on a skewer or spit or something like that.  Whatever..food is still good here and I plan on becoming a semi-regular since I live so close.",

We got the tandoori calamari (a ridiculous name for just fried calamari w/ curry powder on them and nothing to do w/ an oven), the dates which weren't as good as Firefly, the lobster gazpacho that had a nice presentation and very tasty, and the rolled eggplant dish that was just a small lasagna but tasty.\n\nThe staff was extremely attentive..almost to the point of funny but it was fine.

    "text": "Nothing says love like red wine and redder meat.  \n\nWow. 3rd most expensive dinner we've had in LV with Nobu and Picasso at 1 and 2. Decided this would be a nice splurge for our 3 year wedding anniversary and it certainly was. I was glad I read a bunch of Yelpers reviews before going as it made it MUCH easier to choose what to get and all that. \n\nWe went with a 9pm rez after seeing Phantom. Both of us had intentionally skipped lunch in anticipation and I even went to the gym 3 days in a row haha. The atmosphere was pretty loud. Not exactly the most romantic place but no big deal. The vibe was more fitting for the HRH all-suites tower than Palazzo. \n\nGot a booth instead of the stupid swivel chairs thank god. Wife started with the kobe beef sashimi which was awesome. Pretty much the best carpaccio ever. I could've just eaten the beef sushi-style. I got the big eye tuna tartare after reading everyone's recommendation and it certainly did not disappoint. \n\nAfter reading SO many raves about it..I went with the 10 oz American Kobe ribeye. Wow! You gotta love the marbled, fattiness of the beef. My wife got the regular filet which was also excellent and the difference in how both meats tasted was really interesting. We could only manage to eat half of our steaks but I'm SO looking forward to the leftovers today!!  \n\nThe price of the mac and cheese was ridiculous. I was looking for an asterisk on the menu that said it came with a foot massage or something...tasted awesome anyways. Also went with the broccoli rapini for the other side. Went well with everything. Skipped the sauces and didn't miss them. \n\nFYI..they don't do a locals discount anymore. Whatever..no one comes here to save money. \n\nWe've been to so many steakhouses in LV....I can't say it was the best one we've been to but it was really great.",

    "text": "So I was here w/ a few friends watching the C's/Lakers game a few weeks ago and I'm drinking a 1/2 yard of Pabst.  Well..we're about pretty much done w/ our 1st round of beers and looking to order some food when I accidentally tipped my pretty much empty 1/2 yard glass over shattering it on the table.  4 staff people hurry to the table like there's a virus on the loose and clean everything up in 45 seconds...AND THEN they offer us a free round on them because they're worried about glass in the beers.  \n\nWait..didn't I break the glass??  Weren't our beers pretty much done??  How are we getting rewarded for this??  Ummmm..ok..SURE!!!\n\nSo 5 stars for the service!!  I guess if you're hard up for cash and want a free round that you could intentionally break a glass there....",

We were on the fence on doing the omakase..the waiter was nice enough to offer his own kinda of omakase which would've taken less time.  He said if we went the chef's route that dinner would be over 2 hours.  But alas we went w/ a bunch of different rolls instead.  I can't remember the names off the top of my head but I favs were definitely the toro roll ($25) and the raw thinly sliced kobe beef roll.   I'd like to go back here w/ a group of people.",

They also had 5 coronitas for $4 which is a great deal too.  I may have to ride a bicycle here the next time I come.\n\nThe tamales were awesome.  $4 a pop but 2 would fill you up fine.  We also tried the chili relleno which was only ok.  The atmosphere is nothing special but the staff is supernice and Espee herself greeted all the patrons and was really sweet.  I hope this place is successful.",

Ended up ordering another helping of fingers and catfish along with a pitcher of beer and we were in fried food heaven.  \n\nI did wish the \"spicy\" catfish was actually spicy but that's a very minor thing.  My wife actually liked the chicken more than the fish.  Staff was fantastic.",

We came here just to have a drink and check out the place a few weeks ago and my wife has officially deemed this place to have the greatest appletini she's ever had.  Thanks to Joey the bartender!  He also broke out a menu for us just to look at so we thought we'd give this place a try.\n\nVery friendly and helpful staff, nice atmosphere..not that the Silverton is a dive by any means but if you were blindfolded and just put into this restaurant..you would never, ever guess you were at the Silverton.  \n\nMenu looked great and the prices weren't out of control.  I got the big scallop appetizer ($12) and she got the lobster bisque ($10).  For entrees, she went with the rare 8 oz filet as always ($24) and I opted for the cajun ribeye ($26).  This was by far the leanest cut of ribeye I had ever had.  But I wasn't into the white sauce or cajun sauce they put on it and pretty much scraped all of it off the cut but still good.  We just went with a side of potato puree which was a nice compliment to all the flesh on our plates.\n\nNo room for dessert as usual because the bread was so damn good!!",

We had never been here so thought we'd finally give it a shot.  \n\nFish tacos were the big standout of the happy hour menu.  These are the kind of tacos you imagine eating while vacationing at a beach resort.  I could've eaten 6 of them.  Ahi tuna was also good.  Judging by other patrons around us, the sliders were the most popular so we'll try that on a future visit.  Drinks were fruity and strong although none were too memorable (cause and effect?).  \n\nThey also had a guy doing acoustic guitar renditions of songs by the likes of Van Morrison, Coldplay and the Chili Peppers.  I would've requested Stephen Bishop if we had stayed longer.",

I was out of control. \n\nI did actually have as small as a dinner the night before in order to be as hungry as I could do get my $40 worth of all you can eat.  We started with the dishes at the self serve area.  There were 6 choices at the panini/sandwich/crepe station and we had 3 of them.  The super friendly and helpful gentleman manning the station suggested his favorite which was a slice of baguette grilled in some kind of honey and butter which was outstanding.  My only thought was that it would taste even better while being inebriated.  The crepes were just ok and could've been a little more toasty than spongy but that's just our preference. \n\nThe sushi station was way above the average buffet sushi.  All the nigiri and rolls were made to order with the exception of Simon's signature crispy tuna which were amazing.  I had 8 pieces of crispy tuna and 8 pieces of salmon.  They also had a whole slab of smoked salmon layed out and I probably had 5 slices of that.\n\nThe juice station!  I loved this.  Does any other restaurant offer this as part of the menu?  Please let me know if there is because I would be all over this.  Freshly squeezed fruit, protein shakes, vegetable juices, yogurt smoothies and I could have as many as I wanted to.  Damn, dude!  I must've had 7 glasses of various liquids.  I didn't partake in the extra alcohol deals since I didn't feel like being bombed and then hungover by 4pm.  But the deals were reasonable: $12 for unlimited Black Star beer or $17 for unlimited champagne/mimosa/bellinis or $14(?) for unlimited trips to the make your own bloody mary bar.  I would rather have them make my bloody mary since I would screw it up but it looked quite popular.\n\nAnd on top of all this great stuff there's the a la carte menu.  We had the french toast which I think was encrusted with Frosted Flakes.  It was crunchy, sweet with a soft center.  Genius!  \n\n4 different types of hash.  I generally dislike Hollandaise sauce but it was ok with the steak hash.  We also got an additional fill of protein from the egg white frittata which was packed with 5 different veggies including corn, onion and several peppers.  I was unable to finish the frittata due to the fact they must've used about 12 eggs in it.  \n\nBreakfast pizza is a must.  So wrong yet so right.  Topped with sausage, bacon, country gravy and other ingredients that make diets run and hide.  I inhaled it like a champion.  \n\nYou've probably heard of the meat sweats but have you ever heard of breakfast sweats?  That's what I went through about an hour after the meal.  So much good food.  I am definitely going to pace myself better next time and will definitely do less carbs as well but everything looked (and tasted) so damn good!",

Famous for their portions and general apathy for  human beings sodium/fat/calorie intake...my wife was excited.  \n\nI got the steak and bean chili in a sourdough bowl which also came with 2 more pieces of bread for $10.  Exactly what I wanted and it totally hit the spot for a relatively cold Vegas evening.  My wife for some reason opted for the filet mignon.  I am totally against getting steaks at places like this unless they're dirt cheap since they would never ever compare to the greatness of so many steak places we've been to.  This wasn't cheap but $25 for everything (salad, sides, bread) was doable.  Everything on her dish was ok but the zucchini sticks were really good and went well with the beer.  \n\nI didn't know they sold their own beer.  I had 2 large glasses of the red ale and thought it was great.  I could've gone for another if we had time.  \n\nIf we're back here...I think I would just opt for the bar and appetizer type food.  But then Miller's Ale House is a 2 min walk from here so I probably won't be back....maybe if we're with friends that have kids.",

    "text": "My wife found out about this place through Mixi which is kind of like a Japanese myspace.  Its only been open for 3 weeks and we've wanted to try another izakaya style place besides Ichiza (which was packed for Memorial Day) so we gave this place a go.\n\nThe place is a bit small, not great for groups of over 4 but the atmosphere wasn't bad.  I guess I prefer Jpop over koto music but it was fine.  Their specialty is their yakitori (grilled on a stick) type stuff.  We went w/ the chicken thigh ($2 a piece), wasabi kobe beef ($9), asparagus bacon ($2) and the tsukune which is grilled ground chicken on a stick.  Everything we had tasted awesome.  Not sure what they're putting in their grill for the flavoring but its fantastic and addictive.  \n\nYou can definitely tell that the ingredients used here are of higher quality than Ichiza but the menu is a lot smaller and aside from the yakitori, pricier too.  \n\nOfcourse we weren't full from all the above so we tried some of the rice dishes along with oden (a winter food boiled in a soup..kinda like a hot pot).  My wife got the Tororo don which is gooey potato mixed w/ soy sauce that she loves but I find inedible while I had the ikura don which is salmon roe eggs w/ seaweed on rice.  Both of these cost around $10 a piece and the portions were pretty small.  Just one small bowl of rice w/ the topping.  Definitely disappointed w/ that.  My wife was also bummed that they didn't have natto.  \n\nThe oden was tasty though.  We ordered the chikuwa (fish stick), konnyaku and daikon which were all around $1.50-$2 a piece.\n\nThey only have Sapporo beer but they do have a nice list of sake, shochu and wines which would make this a nice place for some beverages and small food.  I would also recommend just buying the pitcher of beer at $22 a pop as opposed to the $5 glass if your party plans on drinking at least 4 glasses.  You get a WHOLE lot more w/ the pitcher!!!!!  \n\nThe bathroom was funny too as they only have a single unisex stall but they put a bunch of fake flowers on the ceiling w/ a speaker playing bird noises the entire time.  Priceless.  \n\nOverall, I would rate this place 3.5 stars but its closer to 4 than 3.   I am just sticking to the grilled stuff the next time we go back as the rice dish portions are way too overpriced.  A few tables ordered the deep juicy fried chicken ($8) which looked awesome too so maybe we'd get that next time.  They're open til 3am which is cool.  Most patrons there were Japanese..I think I was 1 out of 3 that weren't. \n\nSo yeah..this is a good alternative to Ichiza although I wouldn't say its better...just different.",

We also opted for no appetizer to save room for dessert.\n\nMy wife got the veggie chicken/mozzarella panini with a side of salad.  I got the buffalo veggie chicken wrap with salad also.  The protein they used for the chicken was ok but I've had better fake chicken.  My wrap had a nice spice kick to it but we both preferred the panini.  \n\nThe red velvet cake was pretty interesting.  This was the first time either of us had ever eaten warm red velvet.  The frosting was a bit strange at first but we were definitely liking and ready to get a couple of them to go by the end.  \n\nThe rest of the desserts looked pretty good so I will come back to at least try those.  I'm on the fence about the entrees.  \n\nKinda counting the days til the end of the month already.",

You might even want to order your desserts ahead of time because it was slim pickings by the time we finished dinner at 7:30pm.  \n\nI got a panini with vegetarian turkey, chicken, onion, chipotle sauce and cheese on nine grain bread which was a special for January and it was tremendous.  I'll probably be back before the month is out just to have it again!  The vegetarian taco salad was incredible as well and would make a monstrous yet healthy entree.  I liked how the taco shell wasn't a deep fried tortilla but a baked kinda pita style bowl.  So much awesomeness.  I'm so ready to go back just thinking about it now.  \n\nThe service was attentive and friendly.  They accidentally switched our sandwich orders and sides but made it right and gave us one free dessert to make up for the mistake.  It wasn't even a big deal.  Talk about above and beyond!  Wow!",

    "text": "#500\n\nMy wife and I celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary here.  What a dining experience it was!  \n\nThe complimentary gold MGM limo picking us up right in front of our place was sweet.  You must do this!  We were met by a beautiful hostess straight out of a James Bond film as we rolled up to the Mansion.  An amazing place to check out.  I guess this is what playing $25k a hand in blackjack gets you.  \n\nWe had all intentions of getting the 16 course dinner but realized there was no chance whatsoever of my very petite sized wife having even a hail mary's shot at finishing.  She might've reached course 10 at best.  \n\nNo problem!  Let's just fill up on champagne and do four courses.\n\nThere are so many extremely detailed reviews for this restaurant.  Read all of them!  I'm only going to do notes and observations:\n\n- Is it possible to be too fancy?  This comes close. I love fine dining as much as the next fat Asian with glasses but the word \"stuffy\" came to mind.  Maybe my suit was too tight.  \n\n- The man, the myth, the legend was there.  Right before our appetizers (ah-hem! Une Entree) came out I heard a \"Bon Soir!\" from behind me and there he was in the flesh!  Joel Robuchon!!  He shook our hands.  Joel stops by the restaurant 4 times a year according to the staff and he said we were lucky to see him.  I should've asked Mr. Robuchon to sign one of the rolls from the ridiculously amazing bread cart.\n\n- The lobster salad with fruit was orgasmic.  \n\n- Whoever invented foie gras should go down in history as one of the greatest people ever.\n\n- Veal cheek kind of tasted like if a chicken thigh had sex with filet mignon.  I savored every little bite.  I believe the neighboring table shot me a look after I said this out loud to my wife.  Whatever.  More champagne please!!\n\n- They served us an extra dessert to celebrate the occasion.  It was the white and yellow meringue fruit pie cake I took a picture of.  I forgot what they said it was called. Blame it on the ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah-alcohol.  Tremendous stuff!  We ordered 2 more dessert dishes and THEN the dessert cart came out.  Wow!!\n\n3 hours later we were stuffed and ready for the limo to take us back.  A fantastic gourmet experience I would recommend to anyone.",

I've always had a Fuddruckers nearby wherever I have lived but had never actually stepped inside of one til this time.  I wasn't expecting much.  \n\nMy wife got the three cheese 1/2 lb burger which was probably one of the juiciest burgers I had ever tasted.  Huge!!  We were both glad we didn't order fries.  I ordered the ostrich burger which was less juicy but still very tasty.  \n\nThey also had 1 pound burgers available w/ an even bigger bun for it.  We probably could've ordered that and split it I guess.  Didn't actually get to see anyone inhale one of those but it would've been amusing.  \n\nI also liked the condiments/toppings stations they offered.  All the veggies were pretty fresh.  I was also thinking people could really get away w/ making their own salad here accompany their burger.  I guess they could just smuggle some dressing in or something.  \n\nMy wife loved this place.  We'll be back if we're around the area again.",

What's the Wynn or Bellagio buffet then?  So many multiple orgasms in your mouth that you'll die right on the spot??\n\nWhile there are some good things like the pasta station and the carved roast beef...some of the other stuff was under par like the egg drop soup (enough sugar in it?), sweet and sour chicken should've just been called \"sweet chicken\", pad thai and lemon meringue pie.  And even though the price certainly padded the cons of the place, I don't plan on eating here ever again.  The diner would be a better call unless you're ravenously starving.",

    "text": "Got a great coupon book from the Southpoint so decided to check this place out since we had $30 in free play..which we primarily used for dinner.  Buy one entree, get one free.\n\nThe setup primarily felt like something straight outta the 50s.  The music was also primarily weird.  It was like someone hit the demo button on a Casio keyboard or something.  \n\nWaitress was nice.  My wife got the Southpoint cut and I got the blackend/Cajun cut.  Both cuts were better than buffet cuts..leaner and thicker but I preferred her cut over mine..primarily due to the blahness of the spice/flavor on the cajun cut.  I ended up scraping off the spice off my cut.  Our entrees came with salad which consisted primarily of lettuce and a side.  My wife got the rice pilaf which wasn't very good and I got a dry baked potato.  We were too full for dessert primarily due to the serving portion of the prime rib.  \n\nI also overheard a guy at another table complaining about the dryness of his chicken.  Not sure why he would opt for chicken at a place that primarily serves prime rib.  \n\nDecent meal for the price but I think the Orleans buffet would be a better pick, especially w/o a coupon.",

    "text": "I honestly didn't come here thinking it was going to be THIS good but it was really all that and then some.  You wouldn't think a place located in a mostly deserted plaza whose best outdoor view is of a gas station would be serving such great Italian fare, but they are and it's worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.\n\nAs a lot of other Yelpers say, the atmosphere is nice and cozy.  Service was great and I think this was the only time in Vegas where we had a server that was actually from Italy.  But on a side note, how hilariously fucking awesome would it be if he were American and just doing a terrific Italian accent every night?  I would fall off my chair!!\n\nI am a sucker for any place that hand makes their pasta and they make a lot of theirs in house with the exception of spaghetti and penne.  The parpadelle pasta was insanely good!!  I had it with a tomato sauce that included prosciutto, mushrooms and 2 HUGE meatballs.  Just to avoid going completely carb crazy, we went with a veal dish cooked in lemon butter sauce and that was delicious as well.\n\nThe only disappointment for us was the tiramisu which tasted a little weird so we didn't end up finishing it.  But who freakin cares when they're pushing out such terrific, well priced food?  Consider me a repeat customer!",

    "text": "Meat heaven.  I wonder how many pounds of meat this place goes through a day?  \n\nI've been to this location over 10 times.  First of all there is no reason to EVER pay full price.  Sign up for their email list and they will send you a BOGO coupon for your bday, anniversary, fathers/mothers day (I actually had pictures of my niece stored on my phone in case they asked about our \"kids\" the first time we used them) and a couple of other days.  Need more coupons?  Use your other email account and set up other bdays!  The coupon doesn't work on Saturday though :(\n\nMy wife and I were vegetarian for the entire month on January so this was the best place to end it.  Best things on the menu are the filet, lamb chops, any of the sirloins, the flank steak and ummm...more lamb.  \n\nBest strategy is to get 4 meats and then flip your thingy to red so at least you can enjoy those pieces while they're hot.  Otherwise you're just barraged by piles and piles of meat and you have no idea what is what. \n\nIt's a good thing they haven't hired people with Chinese restaurant dim sum experience or this place could get crazy!!!!!!!!\n\nSure it's not the best quality meat but its one of the best places in town to gorge yourself.  Easily one of the top 3 restaurants I would take a friend that has been in prison for 3+ years.",

My only concern would be that a few of my buds would be standing in front of the register looking at the menu for hours on end trying to decide.  \n\nWaffle pizza?  I might give it a go next time.  Jeff, the owner, talked about waffle tacos.  How about a deep fried waffle, Jeff?",

Simply put....the perfect burger is probably the greatest hamburger I've ever had.  \n\nOn occasion, I have strayed from the perfect burger and tried something else on the menu....the bracket burger...bacon and eggs...El Caliente...all good but nothing beats perfection.  Gruyere cheese, herb mayo, smoked bacon, red onion marmalade and an over roasted tomato..drooooool.\n\nSucks they don't include half off entrees during happy hour anymore but I'm not going to complain.  They also used to have a larger beer menu but no big whoop there either.  Get a beer from Yard House to go!!\n\nUsed the yelp check-in special which gave us an order of twisters.  Can you say potato overload???  Impossible to finish everything.",

Funny but not true.\n\nI got the facebook coupon they were offering in the beginning of July and the ribs were great.  I think a lot of people automatically prejudge because its a chain.  Everyone would be loving this if these ribs were served on a garbage can top in someone's backyard.",

    "text": "There's only one reason to order from Napoli and that's their 30\" MONSTER pizza.  It is, without a doubt, the largest pizza I have ever seen.  The initial reactions from others partaking in this beast is worth the price alone.  We had a party of 6 and still had a ton of leftovers!\n\nI ordered at 10am on a football Sunday.  Obviously a busy time for them so it took over an hour for it to arrive but no big deal.  I was very impressed that I could view the entire menu, make my order and pay for the pizza through the Yelp app via eat24 with such ease.  Delivery was the only way I could get this pizza home unless I wanted to clean out my car trunk to make space or rent a U-haul anyways.  \n\nWe ordered the supreme which had all the usual suspects for toppings.  I honestly thought the crust wasn't going to be very good due to the size but it was alright.  Someone taking a blindfold test between this and Metro would probably say Metro was better but it's all about the show with this \"pie\".",

My wife got the filet as usual, I opted for the bone in filet which was surprisingly different tasting than hers.  My buddy got the bone in ribeye which tasted so good despite being cooked medium which says a lot!!\n\nAppetizers:  mushroom pastry and the buffalo mozzarella w/ sundried tomatoes.  Both were excellent and very flavorful.  I can still taste those tomatoes.\n\nSides:  We all thought the sides were pretty damn creative here.  The creamed spinach w/ a deep fried, breaded poached egg in the middle is pure genius!!  Watch out for yolk splatter when the server breaks it :P  \n\nFrench onion potato gratin was really good too!  I thought the mac and cheese was just ok..a little too watery for me but still good.\n\nDessert: Can't turn down chocolate souffle and we got the peanut butter and chocolate donuts with it which were tremendous.  I didn't think the donuts at Fix could be topped but they were.  \n\nI'll bump this up to 5 stars when I go back and have the rib eye.",

They were giving away free Miller Lite. \n\nBut it all went to shit when the food came.  The prices for happy hour are pretty awesome.  I just wish the food was somewhere close to that too.  Our alligator bites were served cold and sent back.  KFC chicken wings are 5 stars compared to the ones they serve and the pizza was shameful.  \n\nSeriously!  Just buy frozen pizza from the same place you buy the frozen alligator nuggets and give that a shot.  \n\nI'm only coming back for alcohol if there is another visit.",

Went for a work dinner and was seated in the private dining room overlooking the pool and had a door connecting to the high roller room so I could stay on top of the Celtics/Lakers game..fn Lakers.  \n\nI started w/ the caprese salad ($12).  By far the greatest caprese salad I've ever had.  I'm not sure how much crack/cocaine was put in the cheese but suffice to say it was enough to rock my world.  I was torn w/ either getting the a pasta as I'm a sucker for handmade pasta on the premises...the rigatoni with braised beef, sweet potatoes and tomatoes sounded awesome or the lamb chops or the osso buco.  \n\nI eventually went w/ the osso buco ($42) since I wasn't footing the bill :) Wow...the mushroom risotto combined w/ a super juicy piece of meat on top was incredible.  I might have blacked out for a couple of seconds but who knows.  \n\nToo full for dessert...guess I'll have to do that next time.",

    "text": "Outstanding dinner.  I rarely want to shell out this kinda dough on cooked fish but this is a place I make an exception for.  I imagine most of these reviews are 4 stars because they ONLY did happy hour :)\n\nOur server was really friendly and a wealth of information on all the cuts of fish and after some hemming and hawwwing...we went with the Maine lobster roll and tuna tartare for appetizers.  Both were excellent!  The lobster roll was more like a lobster salad tostada and I savored every freakin bite.  My wife's tartare was just as good and she deemed it the best tuna tartare she's ever had.  That says ALOT!!\n\nWe went with the waiters recommendations for entrees and got the Tasmanian ocean trout baked in sea salt and the mustard-marinated black cod.  Amazing cod!!!  I assume for Yelper, Seth Y, that this dish was the one that gave him his \"mental erection\".  The trout was great too but I couldn't get enough of the butteryness of the cod...truly worth coming back for.  \n\nThank god we didn't order any sides because we would've had no room for them.  The entrees came with some small sides on the plate and that was more than enough.  \n\nStill had time before we were off for Viva Elvis so we got the Valrhona Chocolate Custard (aka the red velvet dessert thingy) which was the perfect ending for a fantastic meal.",

    "text": "A top notch restaurant that was delicious from start to finish.  The people working there will literally give you the shirt off their back!  My wife was freezing and our excellent server offered the manager's cardigan to wear during dinner.  Who does that??\n\nWe went with Chef McClain's Signature Menu for $89.  No wine pairings because I am usually too buzzed at the end to appreciate the flavors.  I started with the \"Wagyu Beef Tartare\" with crushed caper aioli, slow poached egg and dark chocolate.  Chocolate and beef isn't a combo I am usually down with but it was a fun twist that totally worked.  I literally could've had this as my whole meal.  The buttered and grilled sourdough bread complimented it perfectly.\n\nMy wife got the \"Foie Gras Brulee\" which was wow, wow, wow.  It was such a creative dish and a wild mix of flavors upon first taste but it just got better and better after each bite.  It's ok to lick the dish, right?  This could have been a dessert and I wondered if the chef ever considered that.  \n\nI got the \"Australian Wagyu Sirloin\" for my main entree.  It was as tender as expected but I was ready to swap after having a bit of the 48 hour beef belly.  That was treeeeemendous and what I would go with had I done it all over again.  \n\n\"Gianuja Pave\" was my choice for dessert.  It's not often I get to try olive oil ice cream with basil jam.  That was a really excellent ending to the meal and kept up with the creativity of the experience.",

    "text": "3.68991234 stars.  I have some serious personal issues with spending as much as I did on Chinese food for 2.  I just imagine my Taiwanese mother looking at this menu and freaking over things like $18 stir fried noodles (with no meat nonetheless) and $28 for essentially 8 dumplings (albeit very good ones) .  But alas...happy wife, happy life!  She really enjoyed the dinner and preferred this over Tao.  I disagree.  \n\nDon't get me wrong.  There were a couple of excellent dishes but it's simply the principle of paying this much for it that endlessly irks me.  So let's start with those:\n\nOUTSTANDING DISHES:\n\nCrispy Duck Salad:  My Hakkasan host recommended this dish to me a week before.  The server said it was her favorite thing on the menu.  Who am I to argue?  It was the best thing we had.  The duck was cooked perfectly and combining it with greens, pomegranate, pomelo and pine nuts made for a super tasty dish.  I am pretty sure I will order this every time I dine here.  It won't be many more unless I am getting comped but this is a MUST HAVE.  \n\nStir-fried Black Pepper Beef Ribeye with Merlot:  Love Me Tender.  Tender is the night.  Tender Love.  Time, Love and Tenderness.  Tenderoni.  I would've included \"Try a Little Tenderness\" but there was nothing little about this.  It was A LOT of tenderness.  Every freakin morsel was juicy and delectable.  I also liked that they included big pieces of garlic mixed in.  To fully enjoy this dish, you should order a side of jasmine rice for $2.  \n\nDECENT:\n\nHakka Steamed Dim Sum Platter:  I won't go into the names of them all but there was shrimp, fish, scallop and duck.  The fish was ground up and then secured in a black squid ink wrap.  The scallop had a little ikura on top which was a nice touch.  I chose to eat the majority of these dumplings straight without sauce to get the full taste of it.  They offered 3 sauces with them but vinegar would have been nice as Yelper Cynthia C. mentioned in her review.\n\nThe cocktails were also decent but I forget the names of them.\n\nDON'T EVEN BOTHER:\n\nTo sum it up, go for the stuff you can't get in a regular above average Chinese restaurant. \n\nFour Style Vegetable in sweet Szechuan sauce:  I didn't plan on ordering this but the server recommended it.  We had also been eating a little more unhealthy than usual that week so both of us thought a few veggies would help.  This was a joke.  The sweet and spice didn't work and the medley of asparagus, shimeji mushroom, yam bean (had the consistency of apple) and tofu was weird for me.  \n\nHakka noodle with mushrooms and Chinese chive: I was recommended this dish before coming and I got it even though I was still skeptical.  This would've been good if it were $5 but not $18.  \n\nThe food wasn't the only thing going on here.  I liked how the tables were sectioned off to handle small and larger parties.  The atmosphere was pretty chill at the time we were there (7pm Saturday) but I imagine it might get a little more rockin later in the evening.  The service was surprisingly excellent and our main server was incredibly nice.  They also offered some tasting courses that looked pretty interesting but you had to have a minimum of 4 to do it.  \n\nI don't regret coming here but there are a lot of better options at this price point in the MGM like Craftsteak.",

This is the best place to eat solo in Town Square for sure.\n\nI like the fact that all the chairs face the window so you don't have to make eye contact with anyone else in the place and there's ample reading material to easily ignore everyone there.  I usually go with the Las Vegas Weekly.  \n\nThe food is decent enough.  The regular size sandwiches are more than enough for one person although none of them are really on the healthy side.  I know some people that love eating here at 4:20 for some reason......",

They don't have their liquor license yet so people were coming in w/ bottles of wine and 18 packs of beer!\n\nWe went with the ginger lobster, crab and fish maw soup, sauteed green beans, jellyfish and squid in XO sauce and they gave us a cold chicken dish on the house.  Every dish was insanely good w/ the lobster blowing everyone away at the table.  I think this might be my new favorite Chinese restaurant in town!!!",

    "text": "This is easily the best gourmet restaurant near my home.  Not only do they have 400 different martinis to try out but they also keep track of the ones via customer card that you've tried before.  Let's be honest.  Who really remembers the quality of their martini after the 3rd one anyways?  $2 off all martinis and appetizers during happy hour (5pm-6:30pm) is a terrific reason to stay a while.  \n\nWalking into Elements reminds me of some of the restaurants located in Brooklyn, NY of all places.  The close but comfortable atmosphere with the new cabin type look would totally fit in and thrive on Smith St or on Atlantic Ave.  Just ignore the fact you can see the Terrible Herbst gas station from the north side windows :P    \n\nMy wife got the \"Jumbo Shrimp Marnier\": shrimp wrapped in prosciutto di parma, Thai basil, orange juice, Grand Marnier, served on a bed of greens.  That was really done well and we both felt the shrimp almost had a lobstery quality of taste to it.  I can't remember the last time we had shrimp cooked with Grand Marnier so that was the biggest reason.  I might have to give this a whirl at home.\n\nI got the \"Prince Edward Island Mussels\": sauteed with coconut milk, yellow masala curry, fennel, basil and white wine.  Mother of god!  Amazing!  The sauce was so out of this world that I asked to box it so I could figure out some way to eat it later (ended up having it with pasta which was great).  I hadn't eaten mussels in quite a while and this reminded why I should more often.  Curry and mussels were a magnificent combination!\n\nThey don't call the main course \"entrees\" on their menu.  They're called the \"main event\".  My wife and I hemmed and hawed for a while over them before settling on the mini pork osso buco for her and the crispy roasted duck for me.  This was a main event as worthy as Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage versus Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat.  Both came with sauteed veggies and an interesting take on sweet potatoes that kind of tasted like turkey stuffing.  I wondered if I was still in Vegas after my first delicious bite of the potatoes but then saw the gas station.  \n\nThe osso buco was tender and full of flavor.  They were cooked with thyme, red wine and plum chipotle and were excellent.   I almost never eat bird skin but the crispness of the duck coupled with the flavor of Maine blueberries and pomegranate juice left me no choice but to devour everything I could until the bones were dry.  \n\nWe even had room for dessert and a third martini.  The apple strudel was surprisingly light and flaky opposed to most I've had.  \n\nCatherine and Jose Luis Pawelek are the heart of it all and make Elements as local as local can be.  Catherine is a terrific hostess and makes everyone feel at home while Jose is the master in the kitchen.  I plan on supporting this restaurant more frequently in the future, one martini and mussel at a time.",

Plus they put some flatbread underneath all the wings which soaks up a lot of the flavor and chicken juice.  Goes great with beer!  They should cook whole chickens here.",

    "text": "My wife and I were on the fence about doing any restaurant week spots since most of the menus weren't outstanding but I am sure glad we came here!  Mozen was one of those place I've had bookmarked forever, mainly for their brunch but $30 for lunch seems very reasonable for such a high rated spot.\n\nThe service was top notch from the get go.  They were very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and even though we almost went a la carte, our waiter urged us to go with the RE menu since \"it's the best of what we offer\".  Who wants to pay more than $15 for Indian curry anyways? :)\n\nThe Benito box offered a variety of diverse flavors.  It was almost like a mini tour of Asia!  The box had chicken tandoori in a mahkani sauce, California rolls (with real crab), garlic naan, miso mustard sliced steak and the matcha tiramisu being the perfect ending for it all.  My favorite was the salmon crudo tartare.  The freshness of the salmon combined with the nice spicy kick it had was fantastic.  I tried to buy another can of this as it would've been just perfect being mixed with a bowl of rice but alas...\n\nThe waiter said he mentioned to the chef that they should offer this combination lunch daily and apparently he scoffed at the idea.  Perhaps too many dishes to deal with all the time?  It would rival Estiatorio Milos for best lunch on the strip if they did.  \n\nWe also had a terrific view of Citycenter during the meal.  I had no idea that many guys wore fluorescent tank tops on a Wednesday afternoon.",

Kinda crazy!  \n\nThe menu was set up well since there were photos for everything which made it much easier to know exactly what was coming. We started with the \"Duck Spicy Salad\" since this was something I'd never seen before.  The salad consisted of duck with pineapple, raisin, tomato, red onion, cilantro, green onion and spicy lime sauce.  That was 360 degrees of flavor although I would've preferred a little less duck skin. \n\nI checked out Dan \"Thai Food Addict\" P's review on my phone and he got the Khao Soi.  I'd never tried Khao Soi and it's not offered in a lot of Thai spots so what the heck.  The only way I could explain it would be imagine if Thailand had ramen.  It had a really good curry broth with 3 kinds of beef (sliced, tendon and chunks) with soft egg noodles along with crispy egg noodles.  I also agree with Dan that there should have been more noodles but maybe it's because I liked it a lot.  My wife got the tofu red curry which was fine.  \n\nCorner Thai has a big sign out front saying they serve the best Thai food in Vegas.  That's a pretty bold statement that they don't live up to, but it's a fine neighborhood spot.",

    "text": "I lived in NYC for 10 years before moving out here.  The 3 restaurants I missed were Peter Luger's, Mamoun's Falafel and Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Although this is the chain version..its as close as I can get to having it in Vegas which is fine with me.  \n\nI was kinda disappointed the 1st time I went since there wasn't enough cheese on it for me and the crust was kinda medium rare.  The 2nd time was much better and tasted a lot closer to the real deal.  I STRONGLY advise ordering extra cheese and extra basil on it.  Otherwise the pizza seems a bit flimsy to me.",

BAM.  \n\nhttp://vegas4locals.com/couponbbkingsbluesclub.html\n\nBuy 1 get 1 free entree.  Happier?\n\nOur party of 12 got a table right by the stage and found out the band was going to start in 20 minutes.  Doesn't make it easy to talk about work does it?  Oh well..let's order some drinks!  Our marketing contact there, Rodney, was awesome. He just brought out massive plate samplers, entrees and more drinks!\n\nSliced fried pickles were extremely addictive.  I actually had to pass the basket down the table to stop.  The ribs were really awesome.  Some of the best in Vegas..still not saying much but I really liked em!!  The pulled pork was also great.  Not a producive work dinner at all but everyone definitely enjoyed it!!\n\nAfter trying a few other things here, I strongly recommend anything that's from the pig.  SWINE FTW!!!!!  Can't wait to get the ribs again.  Forget the wings, chorizo or even breakfast for that matter...that's what Carnegie Deli is for if you're staying at Mirage.\n\nAmbiance was pretty Cadillac Ranchy. The band was rockin.  They at least gotta get that right if the place is named after a music legend.",

    "text": "Look no further for the best Indian food on the strip!  Not like there was fierce competition.  It's pretty interesting that it popped up at the food court of the Riviera of all places.  \n\nI'm still trying to figure out why it's here.  Do guests of the Riviera have a strong fever that can only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors?  All I see are old people playing slots!  It doesn't matter though.  I'm just glad it's here and it's tremendous.\n\nNot only do they have every curry you could want but they serve a lot of south Indian dishes most places don't.  I only wished I was hungrier when I came to try more things.  We ended up ordering the tandoori combo which included 4 different meats and the saag paneer accompanied by 2 orders of naan.  Everything was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.\n\nThe two reasons for no 5 star rating are the location (hate the parking garage) and the price which is a couple extra dollars more than other places.  There are too many Indian options off the strip for lunch at better price points and they're all you can eat.  Still, it doesn't take away from how good their food is.\n\nI can't believe I actually have a reason to go to the Riviera now!",

They had a \"text and receive $20 match play\" but they informed us it took 24 hours to put it on a player's card so we would get it the next time we came.  That's a lock for repeat business.  \n\nWe also had a restaurant.com coupon but it wasn't necessary during happy hour since all drinks were $2 and appetizers were half off.  Everything is full price if you use the coupon.  We ended up ordering chicken fingers, chicken fajitas and the carne asada tacos.  Everything was just OK.  I didn't really like the tacos since the salsa was already put on them and the beef was kinda cold.\n\nWednesday night was insane.  All the regulars were there for the video poker drawings they do so if you're planning to play, avoid Wednesday between 5pm and 8:30pm.  You will not get a seat at the bar.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   \n\nWent back again last week on a Tuesday to redeem the free play and got a plate of the carne asada nachos which were better than what we ate before.  All the patrons sure love their slots and everyone knows everyone else for the most part.  The restaurant area was dead both times but I imagine it would be packed for certain sports events since the TV's are decent.  The football deals sound sweet so maybe we'll try that in the fall.  \n\nThey also just sent us another $20 match play in the mail along with a bogo entree coupon for signing up for their slot club.  I guess we're going back!",

    "text": "This is the typical late night pizza to munch on when you're not sober.  They're not exactly open 24 hours but close enough.  We got a half and half of Hawaiian and Margherita.  That sounded a heck of a lot better after a few drinks but now sounds ridiculous as I type this.  \n\nThe Hawaiian side touted double Canadian bacon, double cheese and double pineapple.  Everything was doubled but the bacon.  The Margherita side was just a cheese pizza with basil and sliced tomato slapped on the top.  The cheese was also burnt on that side due to the fact that the Hawaiian side took longer to cook.  I blame myself.  \n\nYou should ask for a takeout menu before you order because they have coupons you can use right on the spot like 2 x-large (which is actually just a large) pizzas any way you want them for a little less then $18.",

    "text": "Late weekday takeout lunch at 2:30 brought me here after having this place bookmarked for a good 5 months.\n\nI was sooo on the fence about getting a breakfast burrito based on Blair B's terrific review and since it was my first meal of the day.  In the end, I went with the carne asada and a couple of carnita tacos.  The carne asada was pretty good but the pork carnitas blew my mind.  Maybe it was due to my hangover that day I was ready to drive back and have a couple of more.  The pork was so juicy and well seasoned that, like a good movie, I didn't want it to end.  \n\nPhrank took my order and as everyone else mentions in their reviews was very hospitable.  He was also patient as I was the only one in the restaurant at the time looking at the menu for a while.  So many other things on the menu to try!  I would definitely frequent this place more if not for their hours but that's just the nature of their location.  I will be back for sure.",

Its also great that I can get a great bbq fix so close to home.  \n\nI definitely don't come here as much as I should since Shish Kebab House just moved to a bigger space in the same plaza and that's usually my defacto order out restaurant but I'm definitely a big fan of this place.",

    "text": "If I were on my deathbed, I would request to be wheeled over to eat at Bacio because it would feel like a LIFETIME!!!\n\nI dined here because of a $150 food credit.  With so many quality restaurants in Las Vegas, the ones at The Tropicana aren't on the top of my list.  They're not even on the list.\n\nBut color me surprised when I saw their 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings for only $39.  Hey!  That made \"restaurant week\" look expensive.  It's a shame we didn't even get to the third course after 2+ hours.  I felt even worse for the couple from Italy at the next table playing the same waiting game.  Why in God's name would actual Italians eat here?!?!  \n\nTheir saving grace was that the food I did try was actually decent.  The \"Risotto Capesante\" with scallops, asparagus and prosciutto paired with a crispy white wine was surprisingly good.  I would've been happy with this dish as all four courses.  The \"White Peach\" salad I received over an hour later was also good but the wait made it taste a little less good.  My dinner companions ordered a la carte and got the veal parmigiana (huge and juicy) and shrimp risotto 90 minutes after ordering.  If they actually got this whole \"serving food in a timely manner\" down, Bacio wouldn't be a half bad place.  \n\nWhat the heck was going on in the kitchen??  My guess was the chef suffered from narcolepsy.  We had less than 35 minutes to make a 10pm show at Caesars Palace.  I spoke with the manager to express my displeasure and he took the 2 course dinners off the bill.  The server was super nice, apologetic and took care of a round of drinks too.  At least they made an effort to make it right.  They then boxed up our last two courses of lobster gnocchi (rubbery) and apple granola cheesecake.  The dessert then melted in my car and went straight into the garbage.",

How is it possible that every peanut this bar has is perfect??  Is there a guy in the back inspecting each and every peanut? \n\nAside from the fact that most beers start at $8 here..the food is certainly worth coming for.  We had a 1/2 lb of the pastrami and it was pure heaven.  I cannot wait to go back and try the rest of the carved meats.  \n\nIt would be a bit pricey to get drunk at this place...perhaps just show up drunk already??",

I can see why they wanted to get rid of the random green walls \"Sushi Hana\" had.  They added a private room too and the furniture is certainly more izakaya-like.  \n\nThe big difference in this place than any other Japanese restaurant in town is the amount of Okinawan dishes they offer.  This is really the highlight of the place.  Okinawan food is pretty unique and different from standard Japanese stuff.  It would've probably been better to advertise that than the Yakitori which Raku blows away hands down.  I really enjoyed the goya-champaru which along w/ the Orion beer was probably the highlight.  \n\nThe takoyaki (fried octopus balls) was a joke for $6.  I am guessing it was homemade because the ones sold frozen in supermarkets have more tako in them than these did.  \n\nWe tried a bunch things on the yakitori menu like pork belly, short ribs, chicken thigh, chicken w/ fish eggs, smelt and a couple of other things w/ pork belly and smelt being my 2 faves.  \n\nIts not a bad place to have a couple of drinks, staff is friendly and attentive and they are open til 3am every night.  I'm only coming back here for their Okinawan menu though.\n\nBTW...I saw the owner of Ichiza eating at a table upfront as we were leaving.  I guess he had to go to Plan C too.",

While this place isn't traditionally that, they blend a lot of what makes that cuisine great with their own creative twists to it.  \n\nWe couldn't start the meal with anything but the Jamaican Curry Soup.  Anthony M recommended we have it the night before along with pretty much every Yelp review and it was tremendous.  I would strongly consider just getting a large bowl of this with a side of rice for my next visit.  In fact, my wife enjoyed it so much, she ordered another bowl of it WHILE eating her entree.  Who backtracks back to the appetizer?\n\nI got the oven roasted jerk pork shoulder bowl which was rich and filling.  The jerk spice was jerktastic and the portion was pretty generous.  \n\nWe went for the \"perfect chocolate cake\" to finish the meal.  Pretty bold to call it that and while I've had better, it was a nice ending to an awesome meal.",

I went with the linguine fra diavolo with calamari and spinach...I'm always a sucker for squid!  My wife went with the fresh mozzarella sandwich caprese style and we got a slice of cheese to split.  \n\nAll of the stuff was great.  The pasta dish was huge and the sicilian slice was a welcome change from the usual offerings of most Vegas pizza joints.  So much stuff I wanna try the next time we go back.  Can't wait!",

I would like to thank all the other Yelpers out there for trying out all the bad/meh dishes so I wouldn't have to :)  \n\nMade sure to come with a group so we could try other stuff.  I was so close to ending my ban on beef for the month to order some Jack & Coke.  That will probably be the biggest reason for me to come back here.\n\nWe also went with the unlimited sangria for $20 a person.  Figured that 2 glasses of wine would be $24 so what the hay?  They brought over a giant carafe for each person.  One person finishing 2 of those is pretty much impossible.  I'd rather just get a bottle of wine next time.  The sangria was pretty simple and light with no chunks of fruit in it.  \n\nTuna sashimi, poona tuna, sea bass skewers and lobster taquitos were the standouts for me.  All the beef dishes looked soooooo good.  \n\nMy wife ordered Nuttin Honey first and it didn't come until the third round of orders.  Wtf?  Wasn't even worth waiting for.  This was very Panda Expressy.\n\nI thought the Grilled PB&J was gross for dessert.  Way too buttery.  They should've just deep fried the damn thing.",

All of them were tasty and went well with Asahi..garlic salt and pepper, truffle parmesan and sweet potato fries.  \n\nOn a sidenote...has any restaurant truly found a good dipping sauce for sweet potato fries??  I haven't had one although I was thinking something on the sweeter side might be better.  Maybe honey and cinnamon or something.  And another thing...I just read up on truffle oil..it's all just chemicals isn't it?  \n\nI got the Kiki burger w/ egg and it was awesome.  Burgers are always better with egg..that's a fact!!  The bun had a real chinese bread...nikumanish quality to it which I loved and it just made it THAT much better.  Got to try the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers too.  The kimchi was interesting on the Kalbi burger..not the traditional tasting type but really went well with everything else that was going on in between those 2 pieces of bread. \n\nWill definitely be back!",

    "text": "Why the heck did it take me so long to come here?  Forte was great!  Being open until 3am is a big plus.  Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)\n\nThe vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.\n\nWe surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the \"Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates\".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.\n\nOur favorite dish was the \"Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta\".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :P\n\nThe \"Thracian Clay Pot\" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in \"Game of Thrones\" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the \"Bulgarian Mixed Grill\" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha \n\nWe couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.\n\nTheir $20 bottles of wine rocked too!",

Its great that they always change up the menu w/ the different themes every couple of weeks..some hit..some miss but there's no other restaurant I'm going to get such a huge dose of veggies like this place.  We always get coupons in the mail here which make it even better.  \n\nI always get 2 plates when we go in.  One for the specialty mixed salads and the other where I just pile on a bunch of veggies etc.  I never bother w/ the breads/pasta section and usually get a couple of soups w/ the turkey chili and chicken noodle being my faves.  Its cool that Republic of Tea is included in the drinks section too.",

That makes the value pretty phenomenal for what you can get.  I was already fairly loaded when we walked in so we just split pizza and wings which were more than enough.  All for less than $12 before tip!  Yes!!",

If I'm trekking it all the way up Decatur to get here, I'm getting the fusion goddamit!  My wife got the bulgogi burrito which was a monster.  That could be lunch for two.

    "text": "There are few things in life that make me happier than falafel and shawarma.  These guys deliver above average quality for both and I already know I'll be a return customer.\n\nThe falafel plate was around $11 and it was huge.  The balls themselves were smaller than usual but that was made up for in quantity as you can see from the photo I took.  An overall 3.5 star falafel in the world is pretty much a 5 star falafel in Las Vegas.  The plate also came with my choice of 4 sides to make up my salad side of it.  I went with babaganoush, hummus, a red cabbage salad and their Israeli salad.  It also came with a big side of rice and beans so I pretty much had lunch for the next day.\n\nI just HAD to sample the shawarma so being the pig that I am, I got a shawarma sandwich to go too.  The quality of their pita was very good and although I prefer lamb shawarma, their chicken was still great.  They allow to put in whatever you'd like in the sandwich and as much as the pita can fit so I went wild with every little thing.  You should too.  \n\nThe dining area is OK and teetering on hole in the wall status.  I see myself doing takeout orders for the most part.",

    "text": "I went asap after reading Mike C's review!  This is by far the best ramen I've had in Vegas but this would maybe only be a 3 star place if it were located in Japan. Its certainly a 4+ star place in LV.  \n\nWe both got the tonkotsu ramen which was pretty good although more miso-y than I expected.  I got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu I've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  The gyoza was just ok.  My wife (Japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of Japan.  \n\nThis certainly beats the hell out of the prices of Yokohama Kaigenro and I am psyched its so close to my place.  \n\nI'm more of a shoyu ramen guy which is what I'll get next time.",

She had a lot more meat in her sandwich and the turkey was definitely better than mine but both were decent.\n\nIt wasn't the most comfortable place to be eating but whatever.  This is a place for takeout orders.  I honestly couldn't imagine eating in their outdoor area unless you want a dash of desert dust and car exhaust on your food.\n\nYou also get the homeless, downtown crazies that sometimes decide to drop by and yell at the staff saying \"Give me my fucking jack back!\" while slamming the counter.  Whatever the hell that means.  Like I said...TAKE OUT!! Good times.",

    "text": "This menu is a fat kid's dream come true!!!!!!  Just look at some of the combos and toppings they got on these pizzas!!  This comes pretty close to last meal/end of the world type food for me.  \n\nIf you have a \"cheat day\" on your schedule, you might want to make it a \"cheat week\" after ingesting all these glorious calories, saturated fat and cholesterol at one sitting.  We ordered a full Royal sandwich and the wee (smallest) Guinea pie which is really not wee at all could feed 3 Japanese people for lunch alone.  \n\nI now know why The Royal was rated one of the best sandwiches in Vegas last year by LV Weekly.  I loved how they just made the Italian sausage into one huge patty layered with all this cappicola and mozzarella.  A total flavor explosion!  The Guinea pie was equally as awesome with meatballs, spinach and cheese, cheese, cheese.  I really liked the thick crust.  \n\nWe had no shot at finishing everything but they made for some great leftovers the next day.  Tons of other menu items I look forward to having like \"The Stinger\" which features chicken fingers, steak, three cheeses, hot & sweet peppers, blue cheese and lettuce in one sandwich!!  What??????  That's Man vs Food type shiznit right there!\n\nI also dug all the rock music they played in the bar.  Service was very friendly too.  This is also a Buffalo Bills bar so be warned.",

It has probably been a good two years since I had pho.  That's weird for me to say or even fathom but hitting up all the places I have bookmarked ain't easy.\n\nMy wife got the rare beef pho which she said was the best pho she's had in LV.  I didn't even have a shot at trying it since she scarfed it down so quick.  I went out of the box and got the curry pho which was filled with veggies and dark meat chicken on the bone.  I really liked the flavor and you could tell this broth had been simmering for quite some time.    \n\nMisti Y's review of Kinh Do was the one that stood out while deciding which pho spot to choose.  Lo and behold..who do we run into there but Misti and Bobby Y!!  I didn't notice her review was 2 years old but we still liked it a lot and definitely plan on getting our next phix of pho here!",

High ceilings, less cramped and more parking space.  \n\nThe menu hasn't changed much from what I remember but I did notice a couple of things like the lobster corn dogs and lobster \"escargot style\" so we got those at $10 a plate.  The corn dogs were the only disappointing dish of the night.  The breading was not good and it was kinda soggy.  The escargot lobster was tasty.  I suppose anything cooked escargot style would be.  \n\nAside from the usuals like bacon wrapped dates, empanadas (pork is better than the vegetarian) and sliders, we went with our waiter's one suggestion of the warm spinach salad.  Glad we did that!  Who knew warm wilted spinach with pine nuts, roasted peppers and artichoke would be so good??  I think whatever dressing they had going on knocked it out of the park.  The sangria packed a nice punch as well.  I would be fine coming back to this location.",

I was pretty surprised since its a stand alone restaurant in TSq right next to Fry's.  \n\nBut $8.95 for a bucket of 5 Miller Lites is pretty good.  We split the mahi mahi fish tacos...I love fish tacos.  Decided we were still hungry so we got the fish and chips. The portion was HUGE.  How does a single person ever finish this?  The waitress said it never happens.  Nice, crispy, fried goodness.  \n\nThe night was extra sweet watching Vick destroy the Skins in one of the greatest NFL performances ever.  That also gave me a \"W\" for fantasy football along with winning my pickem pool for the week!!\n\n$46 including tip for everything.  I'll try to get here earlier if I come back for MNF.",

    "text": "The owner of my company had the Patty Wagon roll up at our place for a couple of hours treating all the employees to lunch.  I am a BIG fan of the restaurant so I had high expectations.  It was a set menu of either a cheeseburger, urth (vegetarian) or a hot dog with a drink, choice of side (iceburg lettuce salad, mixed greens salad, chips or fries) and a chocolate chip cookie as well.  \n\nThe cheeseburger was a no brainer.  I was hoping to get as close to a perfect burger as possible but the only ingredient I could get was gruyere cheese :(  Still a decent burger but it doesn't do the restaurant any justice.  It was a bit smaller than their home joint serves and try carrying the burger, salad, cookies and drink back to the desk.  Now you know why I don't do trucks.  Salad was fresh and the cookie was fine.    \n\nIf I see the truck, I'll probably order but I won't seek it out when I can go to their Red Rock location for a much better experience that I can wash down with a beer or two.",

    "text": "Saw their coupon in LV Weekly for March Madness which advertised $4 nachos, $2 for 2 sliders and $1 hot dogs along with $20 match play...so what better place to sweat my NCAA brackets?  Which all fell to pieces this past weekend but that's what I get for watching less than an hour of cbball the entire year.  \n\nMy wife got dealt a 9 high straight flush on a 3 play machine the first time we went which took care of the food and then some.  I ended up breaking even but still get $20 profit because of the match play.  That just went to overtipping the super friendly staff anyways.  \n\nThe food is definitely better than the average bar with the sliders being some of the best I've ever had.  How are they THAT juicy?  My wife loves the chicken fingers here since they bread and fry them to order.  She jokes that the fingers are so big..they should just start calling them chicken hands.  \n\nUnfortunately they got rid of the $20 match play our next time there since a ton of people were abusing the hell out of it.  Figured as much.  So basically they would only give players another $20 if they lost the first $20.  No big deal.",

I took Janel's advice in her review and went with the double order of the pork for the BBQ combo the second time around.  The crispy juiciness of the meat mixed with the fat was phenomenal.  I've neglected Chinese spots with hanging meat for too long.  I used to eat this stuff at least once a week.    \n\nThe duck is also tasty but I recommend asking for a breast cut.  Some pieces of the thigh were straight up skin and fat.  While some people appreciate it, I am not one of them.  I also had their chicken chow fun which is something I'll certainly order again.  \n\nThe service is also pretty friendly compared to most Chinese places around but it's all about the pork!",

Is this breakfast or dessert?\n\nHoly pancake overload, Batman!  Everything was delicious.  My wife said it was the best corn beef hash she had ever eaten.  \n\nWe finished everything and went into a  total food coma.  3pm turned into nap time and I don't think we had dinner that night.  Not sure if it was the carb overload or the sugar crash or both but wow.\n\nI'm gonna do something eggy next time with a short stack so it doesn't kill me for the rest of the day.

Is it really a calzone?  Or just the biggest empanada in the history of the world?  All of its sexiness can't fit into a pizza box!!  \n\nI prefer spicy brown mustard over the yellow Biaggio gives with it which is a reason why I got it to go.  Not like it would be weird to bring your own mustard to a restaurant...would it?  I once met a woman on an NYC subway that brought her own relish to Yankee Stadium but I digress.....\n\nThe pizza is always solid here.  Great ingredients and you can really tell the difference.  There's a ton of other good stuff on the menu to try too...like their wings!",

    "text": "It hurts to write this update.  Biaggio and his staff are super friendly and will bend over backwards to get things right.  Maybe this just wasn't their night last week.  But it still shows how far they'll go for customer satisfaction.   \n\n7:45pm: We feel like a pizza.  Just moved closer to Biaggio and the last 2 experiences we had there were good so what the heck.  I order a large supreme with extra cheese.  The lady over the phone tells me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.  \n\n8:10pm: I arrive and the cook informs the cashier he hasn't even started my order yet.  She seems shocked.  There was some grumbling back there with Biaggio and the staff.  Biaggio come up to me and apologizes profusely for the mishap, gives me my $23 back and said he would take care of me the next time as well.  I didn't think it was that big a deal and did not make a stink over it at all.  I said it would not be necessary to take care of me on the next trip and tipped $3 to the staff.  The pizza comes out unusually fast and I go home.\n\n8:27 and 24 seconds:  Arrive home and bring the pizza to the dining table and my wife takes the first bite.  The green peppers are COLD.  The pizza is not even warm and the consistency of the cheese is weird.  It was as if the cook took a cheese pizza that had been sitting out for a while and attempted to reheat it with the toppings he just added.  I thought I could just ignore all this and eat it but after half a slice, I called the restaurant and explained the situation.  The cashier offers to deliver a hot one to my house at no additional cost.  Fine!  Why would the cook think he could get away with giving me that first pizza?  Did he just think we wouldn't notice?  It was kind of offensive.  I've never returned a pizza ever before!  I couldn't believe it. \n\n9:03: New hot pizza arrives and it's definitely oozing with cheese.  It doesn't have as much pepperoni or sausage but still way better than the first one.  The thing was that this new pizza was NOT five stars.  Not even close.  I could rattle off 5 other places off the top of my head that were better than this.         \n\nBut the service, effort and attempt to do right is what saves it from giving them 2 stars.  I honestly believe this could've been just a bad night but I hadn't eaten there in over a year and won't give it five stars if it doesn't deserve it and tonight it certainly did not.  I am coming back for wings and pastrami but on the border for pizza.",

This place automatically gets 5 stars for sucking us into their French culinary vortex filled with delicious quiche, croissants and pastries.\n\nEverything looks great here.  I swear we're looking at the choices for a solid ten minutes everytime as the lunch crowd continues to ask us \"Umm..are you in line or just looking?\".  Then we do the same thing for dessert.  \n\nThe $8.95 lunch combo is great bang for your buck.  You get your choice of a soup (usually more than 5 choices), sandwich (baguette, croissant or panini) and drink.  The baguette sandwich is HUGE.  They cut it into quarters and could easily feed 2.  I'm still trying to perfect my ideal panini but prosciutto, swiss, onion and mustard did me fine.  \n\nMy wife loves the quiche.  We've tried the four cheese, veggie and bacon and the mushroom.  To have one of these everyday would be amazing.\n\nWe always try to save room for dessert and usually split a tart or some kind of cake.  Eclairs, black forest cake, assorted macarons, fruit tarts..I feel like I'm on a game show and need to make a choice asap.  But alas I shouldn't feel pressured! I will be back for more!!",

Glad we did!!\n\nThe food was tremendous.  The prices aren't that bad either.  Not the most romantic restaurant..much better for a group.\n\nBefore I get into the food..I have to mention how good their Comme Ci cocktail is.  They got a whole prohibition cocktail thing going on which is all the rage but the Comme Ci was the real deal...totally refreshing.  It was some kind of cucumber, lemon and pepper thing with white rum.  I can't wait to drink these on their balcony during 100 degree weather.  They are $15 though so I gotta try to figure out how to make these at home.  \n\nAppetizers:\n\nSalade Frisee aux Lardons: Warm bacon vinaigrette, poached egg\n\nOur awesome waiter, Keith, mentioned the French eat this salad at home.  If this is true...I'm inviting myself to every random family dinner the next time I'm in France!!  I couldn't get enough of the cured bacon with egg yolky goodness covered over everything.  \n\nSteak Tartare: Coleman Ranch beef, capers, cornichons\n\nI had never had Steak Tartare prepared the way they did it.  They mixed the beef in some kind of mayo/horseradishy sauce and it was so fn good.  I could've eaten this as my main course.\n\nEntrees:\n\nCrispy Skate Grenobloise: Haricots verts, lemon, capers, brown butter\n\nBEST SKATE EVER!!  Nothing else to say.  \n\nDuck Confit: Pommes Lyonnaise, braised red cabbage\n\nNot like I eat duck confit very often but a lot of restaurants seem to use duck breast for it now but duck thigh is really where its at!  Super juicy and flavorful.\n\nDessert:\n\nChocolate Pot du Cr\u00e8me: cardamom cr\u00e8me chantilly\n\nLike the best Nutella ever.  \n\nThere are so many other things I have to try on the menu.  They also have daily specials along w/ raw bar.",

    "text": "Found a BOGO deal and I wouldn't come roaring back here based on what we ordered.  What we had was OK but OK just doesn't cut it in a town full of great burger choices. \n\nGot the Spicy Baja which was described on the menu as with \"pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalape\u00f1os on a spicy chipotle bun.\"  Not spicy enough for me.  People who order this want to burn and it fails to do that.  The patty was big and it looked like a great burger but it was overdone to my liking.\n\nI liked my wife's Sin City burger much better.  We actually ended up switching halfway through.  That burger was stacked with \"fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun.\" I ALWAYS want eggs on my burger.  The flavor was much better than the Spicy Baja and if I would order this if I were to do Smashburger again.  \n\nWhat's with the metal tray things they serve the burgers on?  A plate would've been better.  I found them awkward.  Stuff will fall off your burger and it would just be easier to scoop off something without holes.",

    "text": "This location always has a ridiculously long line out the door.  You'd think they were going into a niteclub.  We had some comp dollars to burn and for some reason both Baja Miguel's and Primarily Prime Rib had 45 minute waits to be seated.  Hell, even the Coronado diner and their terrible buffet had a wait.  \n\nSOOOOOOO..welcome to \"plan E\".  \n\nWe opted for the takeout line and to eat at one of the booths by the sportsbook.  Still had to wait about 20 minutes for our order.  The shakes the servers kept walking by us with looked freakin awesome but I didn't feel like drinking 800 calories and 70g of fat.  \"Save it for the burger\" I told myself. \n\nFinally sit down ready to eat and were pretty disappointed at what dinner looked like.  It didn't get any better after the first bite.  The patties were thin and dry and the fries had no seasoning on them.  What a total waste of calories and fat.  Whoppers taste a million times better than this.    \n\nWhat the hell am I missing??  Why would anyone spend an hour in line for this crap let alone 20 minutes?  Where is the STEAK in Steak n' Shake?  I'd rather eat frozen chicken nuggets.",

    "text": "There are a lot of cool things about this buffet that no other place has but most of it was pretty average or subpar.  Having shawarma on a spit is an awesome idea but it wasn't that good.  Risotto is something different but it was pretty meh.  Crab stir fried in some kinda butter sauce might sound appetizing but I would rather just have a plate full of cold crab legs and crack them myself.  \n\nThey had the most lamb I'd ever seen in a Vegas buffet including ribs, leg and mini chops (prob my favorite thing in the whole place).  I also enjoyed the different individualized portions of pasta.  Wish I had more room for dessert.   \n\nAnd what's with the bottles of water they bring to the table?  There's a reason why every other buffet gives patrons those huge tumblers of water.  So the servers can deal with other stuff...like taking finished plates off the table.  Some of our plates sat there for a pretty long time before they got picked up.  We also had to repeatedly ask for more water and coffee before they actually brought it.  \n\nI can think of at least 5 buffets in town I would rather go to than this one for the price though.  Might be a one and done for me.",

The paella was rich, flavorful and I gnawed on every rib until nothing was left.  \n\nI semi contemplated another order but then the manicotti/lasagnaesque/alfredoey pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce shut me the heck up :)  My wife wasn't a fan of because it was too cheesy and creamy but I am down for anything foie gras related.  \n\nThe seared fresh squid with squid ink sauce, artichokes and pearl onions was delectable.  Nice presentation!  It's rare for a place to serve the whole squid with innards and all.  I initially thought it was stuffed and couldn't put my finger on what was in it until our friendly server informed us.  I'd totally have squid ink as a hot beverage by the way.   \n\nBottom line is I need to come back here with a bigger group to sample more stuff like a heckuvalot more black foot pig.  If they ever make Pulp Fiction 2, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace might have a discussion over the $20 gin and tonics.  Oh wait, he was killed.  Nevermind.  I am ready to go to \"e\" asap!",

    "text": "I have no legit excuse why it has taken me so freakin long to hit up this place for lunch.  It's not like there aren't enough 5 star reviews on it already:P  I've read them all, had this place bookmarked forever and it lived up to the hype!  Definitely won't take as long to come back here.  \n\nMy petite wife gets cold pretty easily.  Anyone else ever bring a snuggie to the movie theater?  So being seated on the terrace was the clear choice.  The sunlight, high ceilings and decor really transports you somewhere else.  The indoor dining area isn't too shabby either but this is where it's at!\n\nDown to business!  The 3 course lunch for $20.12 was what we were here for.  \n\nAppetizer:\n\nMy wife got the Greek meze plate which had tarama (creamy paste with fish roe), tzatziki (cucumber yogurt), htipiti (Greek feta dip, kinda like hummus), manouri cheese (like super creamy feta), olives and cherry tomatoes along with a side of pita.  Yum yum.  The tarama was the clear standout as it was the first time either of us had eaten that before.  I love fish roe and all things caviar.  \n\nI shelled out the extra $10 for the grilled octopus: sashimi quality Mediterranean octopus, charcoal-broiled with lemon and olive oil.  It was worth every....single....penny.  Grilled octopus has to be one of the top 10 meats of all time!  I cut the pieces even smaller to try and savor each bite.  \n\nEntree:\n\nAnd just when I thought things couldn't get any better...they DID!  The waiter and a lot of Yelp reviews stressed the Lavraki (grilled Mediterranean bass) and it was so fucking good.  I could eat this for lunch 3 times a week for the rest of my life easy!!  A whole bass grilled up with lemon and oil was simple yet perfect.  I even ate the head bits and eyeballs for chrissakes!! \n\nMy wife went with the tuna burger but it was pretty much carb overload at that point.  Between the second bread basket, pita from the meze and then the bun on the burger, she just went from the protein.  The tuna was cooked nicely.  I think there was an orange slice in it?  The zuchinni fries were great as well.  They added mint to them which had them take on a whole different taste than the usual way they're done.  \n\nDessert:     \n\nWalnut pie with kaimaki ice cream was like a super spiced coffee cake and my wife loved the yogurt martini.\n\nI am not so hot on the dinner prices here but I would recommend this lunch to anyone.  I am ready to go again!",

Never happened and might not until they get the hot pot buffet going again in winter.  Misti convinced me I could still write a review of a place I've only sat in waiting for my togo order.    \n\nWhy don't I ever eat here?  It's always just me and the lady in there when I order.  I don't care about eating at a table for 1 but not when I'm literally the \"one\". \n\nEverything I've ordered has been solid.  Not only do they have the cheapest whole lobsters and crabs in LV cooked multiple ways, they can do it all.  I really like the seafood noodles, anything with rock cod and all the beef dishes.  Yeah yeah...really narrowing it down there.  Can't go wrong with anything.\n\nSure it's in a divey plaza and basically an indoor desert during dinner time.  But who the heck cares when scallion and ginger lobster is $14?!?!  I hope this place has the legs to stick around town a while.  Go!!",

They say it's the same chef as before but I have my doubts after getting chicken fried rice where the chicken appeared almost deep fried and breaded.  That would be awesome Chinese fried rice for a redneck in the middle of the deep south!!  Not sure what liquid the lo mein was drowning in either but it wasn't what I wanted at all.    \n\nIn a nutshell, this place has gone all Red Shrimp Company to cater to the Chimerican palate except Red Shrimp does it better.  I can't say I'll be back.  So disappointing!!!",

This place is the closest I've ever come to a real NYC slice in LV.  \n\nWe got a slice of cheese, pepperoni and veggie which came out to $11.75.  That's STILL less than 1 piece of shrimp next door at Blue Ribbon!  I was surprised I liked the plain slice the best.  Not that their other ones weren't good.  Sometimes great pizza doesn't need anything else but sauce and cheese.  \n\nWish there were more places to sit but not that big a deal with so much seating in the middle area of the 3rd floor.",

But when we sat down and were handed menus...they were asking where the pencil and checklist were. \n\nRealizing these guys were not sushi connoisseurs whatsover we almost bailed and went to Sushi Mon. The ambiance was great though and the cocktails convinced us to stay. Glad we did. \n\nI am so anti getting edamame at restaurants it's not even funny. Why would you pay $4+ for a little bowl when you can buy a whole bag for less and eat it at home? But that's the first thing my buddy orders...go knock yourself out man..for $8! \n\nI had a couple of them and it was ridiculous. If I'm paying that much for edamame..it should be at least served cold like in real Japanese restaurants and not straight out of a boiling pot. Give me a break. AYCE places whatever...I always assume it'll be served hot but $8 in a place like this?!? Its just the principal itself goddamit!! \n\nAnyways...the quality of fish was outstanding. The maguro served had that really deep red color I sometimes dream about. I savored every single piece of sushi and sashimi I had. \n\nI was also eyeballing some really cool items I plan on ordering in the future with sushi snobs like the lobster sashimi. I will certainly be doing the omakase next time I'm here.",

    "text": "I hate to slag on this place since their location on West Flamingo is one of my go to spots.  But I gotta call it like I see it.  \n\nFor reasons I won't go into..I'm vegetarian for the month of January.  I am pretty much hating it so far and I'm only 5 days in but I figured I would try this place out since they offer a few things the W.Flam location doesn't.  These things include gyros, beef shawarma and FALAFEL.  \n\nI got the falafel plate since the only alternative was a \"falafel burger\".  I would've ordered a falafel sandwich w/ pita had that been a choice.  \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty much set up for people on the go.  I imagine people on conventions might get a quick bite here.  Drunk bastards/bitches would be fine here since they're open til 3am daily and all their furniture is plastic.  \n\nSo I was a bit excited when they brought out my plate.  4 huge falafel balls along with the usual things Shish Kabob House offers like the roasted pepper and tomato.  But they don't include salad at this location and the rice isn't as good here.  \n\nMy excitement completely died as I had my first bite .  Dry, bland..almost like eating an overdone oatmeal raisin cookie and it kinda crumbled like it too.  They also served a side of super thick kinda tzatziki sauce which didn't go too well with it.  I would have much rather had tahini or hummus but I am not shelling out $4.95 for a side order of it.  Really unsatisfying.  \n\nI have no question that their kabob menu is just as excellent as the original location but they shouldn't be serving falafel here.  The W. Flamingo location is better to go to..ambiance (even though they use folding tables), side salad with your entree and music from their country as opposed to Fuse TV playing at the strip location.\n\nI might be back here...but it'll only be for LAMB CHOPS!!!",

    "text": "The wife and I went here to see the Steelers beat the Jets in the AFC championship game. I've been to PJ Clarke's in NYC a few times so I wanted to see how this was. \n\nThe location on the 1st floor of the newer Forum Shops area is kinda weird but the set up is pretty nice. I can't believe Villa Reale was in the same spot a year ago. \n\nIt was pretty easy to find 2 stools at the bar. Beer prices were standard for the strip. I can't justify paying $7 for a pint of Miller Lite so I opted for $10 bottles of Duvel. You're pretty buzzed after 3 of those babies. \n\nThe bar has an interesting widescreen TV built into the wall. Its a set of 8 screens that combine into one and can separate to 2, 4 or 8 things showing. It looks like a mirror when the TV is off which is kinda cool. The lines between the screens still annoyed my when watching the game on the full screen though. The bartender told me the bar was able to obtain this pre CES and its the only place in the US to have one. He also said it cost more than 6 figures to purchase and install which is kinda crazy. \n\nWe also got an order of fried calamari Rhode Island style which had a lot of hot peppers on it and tasted great. This is also the only place I've ever ordered calamari where no tentacles were served. I dig the tentacles!! \n\nRaw bar looked awesome but its hard to compete with Joe's right across the way. The bartender also said they haven't done any marketing for the place yet. What's taking so long?",

    "text": "I spent so much time with my eyes closed throughout the 21 courses in an attempt to fully savor the amazing range of flavors bestowed upon my taste buds that I probably came off looking like Stevie Wonder's mentally challenged 3rd cousin as I swayed side to side to the other diners.  Overjoooooooooyed!  \n\nSangria 2015: Frozen red wine accompanied by little bursts of fruit presented in a half bottle to be scooped with two little spoons.  This must be how Willy Wonka gets bombed while watching reruns of \"Friends\".  It was a terrific \"beverage\" to start the meal.    \n\nSpanish Pizza: I love burnt cheese like nobody's business.  These geniuses of food made it the crust for heavenly bites topped with Andres' fantastic \"Jamon\" and ricotta cheese.  How much would a full on large pizza like this be?  $1000?  More?  Unreal.  What is it like to be the duke/duchess here?\n\nBeet Gazpacho:  Appearing like a fancy French pastry sold at Jean Philippe, the intense flavor was pretty eye opening, not easy for an Asian guy :D  That they even pulled this kind of richness out of a beet, one of the most non-offensive, unassuming vegetables ever (the Greg Kinnear of veggies?) is beyond me.  The sorbet-like quality was surely a big reason. \n\nIberico Chickpeas:  This gave me the satisfaction and entertainment of every Vegas show I've seen in the last year all in one bowl and in less than 5 minutes.  Through the spherification cooking technique, the garbanzo beans had an ikura quality to it where they would pop in your mouth with only slight pressure.  Mixed in with the rest of the ingredients (I may have blacked out due to culinary ecstasy when the chef explained everything), the explosion of tastes in each spoonful was otherworldly.  I was the last one to finish as I wanted to savor every bean to its maximum potential.  \n\n\"Empanada\": Foie Gras cotton candy gyoza.  Formed, pressed right before our very eyes and eaten by hand, the combination of the fatty duck liver, light candy sweetness and Corn Nuts (?!), was an incredible mix that floored me.  Sign me up for 100 of these.      \n\nBrandida Bacalao: Salt fish chicharron topped with truffle.  The fish air foam the chef delicately placed on top of each our pieces was like a fairy godmother granting wishes.  Light, airy and amazing, this could have probably been finished in two bites.  I ate it like a rat and managed six.  Are the employee dinners anywhere close to the magnificence of this stuff?  I would wash dishes for free.\n\nFun, creative, and extremely delicious, I'd gladly go back in a heartbeat.  If forced to choose, I'd go with \u00e9 over Joel Robuchon considering the similar price point and for overall entertainment factor, but you couldn't go wrong with either for a dinner and show all rolled up into one.  This was a fantastic meal for our 8th wedding anniversary.  We were lucky to get the reservation and our golden tickets less than 3 weeks out.  \n\nFull Menu:\n\nSangria 2015\n\"Vidrio\"\nFilipino\nPillow\nDado\nBeet Gazpacho\nSpanish Pizza\nVermut\nCheese and nuts\nChupito\nBrandida Bacalao\nIberico Chickpeas\nTxipirones\nPlatija\nChuleta\nEmpanada\nSanta Gadea\nMenjar Blanc\nAfter Eight Timbal\nFerrero Rocher\nYemita",

No chance of my napkins flying away in the wind while I'm trying to put ketchup in a paper bag full of fries? I'm THERE!!\n\nThe set up of HQ is awesome...all the art, lights and music.  It feels like the Jabbawockeez could come rumbling out from the kitchen and break into a full blown performance in the middle of this place.    \n\nWe've had all the burgers on the standard menu with the Pep being my personal fave.  I had to try the mystery slider too.  The name escapes me but it was pretty wild.  It included fried chicken, mozzarella sticks, bacon and some other goodies.  Pretty much the greatest slider for 4:20.  \n\nThe other highlight for me were the superfries.  Quite possibly some of the best late night drunk combinations ever.  One order could easily be enough for 3 people.  You couldn't go wrong with any of their selection.\n\nStaff is great too!",

    "text": "A little wine and pizza for lunch. And although a lot looked great on the appetizer end of things..we got what we came for. One roman and one Neapolitan. \n\nOrdered the prosciutto e rucola for the Neapolitan pizza which was awesome. The smoked buffalo mozzarella really brought it to a whole new level. Crust was light, chewy and just the way we like it. \n\nThe roman margherita was just ok. We weren't crazy about the crust but I think that's just our preference. Will probably be the one and only time we get roman. Glad we tried it though. \n\nNice wine selection. Friendly service. Atmosphere was great. We'll definitely take advantage of the outdoor seating when it isn't windy. \n\nDefinitely top 5 pizza for Vegas but there's another place that begins with \"S\" in Henderson that's still #1 for me.",

    "text": "By far the nicest setting for an izakaya in town. So cool how everything is set up. We took a couple of seats at the bar to watch the chefs do their magic while we ate.\n\nDefinitely over-ordered based on our initial excitement over the menu choices and prices but no big deal. Stand outs included the best chawamushi in LV, yuzu chili salmon and grilled squid. The only thing we weren't into was the ika no shiokara (fermented squid guts). I never liked that dish but even my Japanese wife who normally likes it thought it was too creamy and a bit off. \n\nAside from that, the whole dining experience was great. The staff was super friendly, very helpful and accommodating. Just what you'd expect from a high end izakaya!",

    "text": "I'm seriously considering going back to all my AYCE sushi reviews and moving them down a star. THAT's how good it was. \n\nI can't believe this is the 3rd Japanese restaurant in this location in 5 years. To go from Sushi Hana to Shin to this. Goyemon has by far the best decor of the three. Sushi Hana just had these gross green painted walls and an old ass TV showing ESPN for chrissakes! \n\nAlong with your usual suspects for nigiri and rolls...they have a ton more including daily specials. Highlights included their inhouse smoked salmon (smokiest salmon ever!), big eye tuna nigiri and \"kobe\" beef nigiri although the beef being kobe was highly suspect. No big deal. Pork belly was like the best piece of bacon ever. \n\nI also like how yellowtail collar (1 order per person) is on the menu. So good! Its like a super meaty fish chicken wing kinda sorta. A must. \n\nWe were pretty lucky to be seated around 6pm since there was a bit of a wait for tables about 10 min later. Not that many seats so definitely be prepared to stand around for a while. \n\nI love how this is so close to my place. No more drives to Sushi Mon on Sahara for me. I'm actually ready to go back here...like...now.",

The predominant thought running through my head after looking at this menu was \"Why the hell did it take me so long to come here??\".\n\nSuper cheap prices!  You could spend more and get far less at any fast food restaurant.  I got the Hai Nam chicken and my wife for the shrimp soup with udon.  Both were very tasty and filling.  We finished up our meal splitting an almond jello dessert for a whopping bill of $11.20.\n\nGreat, friendly service too.  The staff knew a lot of the guys in the group by name.  The owner came in to say hello and gave us a few plates of shrimp wonton appetizers on the house.  There were so many other dishes that looked great.  A lot of people in the group doubled up on entrees since they were so cheap and I look forward to trying more of the menu.  Consider me a Big Wong believer!!",

LBS didn't accept the coupon so we opted for this.  \n\nMy wife got the corn beef hash which came with eggs, hash browns and toast.  Good portion but she's definitely had better.  I got the California benedict for $10 and that was a total joke.  Small plate portion and I guess the chef doesn't know how to poach eggs either.\n\nLooked like all the regulars were getting salads.  Maybe that's what I'll go for next time although I am pretty sure I am not coming back.  I'd do IHOP over this anytime.",

    "text": "Been DYING to come back here after Misti's wonderful CMYE at LVG last month.  The restaurant.com coupon made the meal even better although $35 worth of food for 2 is basically a buffet at the table :P\n\nLVG has the best ribs I've eaten in Las Vegas.  It's true!  I'm all about St. Louis style ribs now and on the verge of texting baby back ribs to tell them we're through.  The juicy tenderness and smokey flavor make them truly unbeatable.\n\nThat's not the only thing that's awesome here.  Thai green curry sausage!!  Amazing.  Phil's a genius!  Not me but the owner haha.  The bbq chicken is also super good.  The breast was actually juicier than the thigh somehow.  The red cabbage, red potato salad and pasta salad sides accompanied all the meats perfectly with the pasta being our top favorite of the 3.  \n\nWe were on senior citizen time and ate dinner around 4pm so we were the only ones in there.  We chatted it up with Phil for a good part of the dinner and he informed us of some great new additions to the menu coming up in December like prime rib and double smoked ham.  Like you needed more of a reason to come here...more of a reason to come here everyday!!!",

    "text": "I've been searching for a new \"go-to\" taco place since Los Parados on W. Sahara closed a while back.  Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!\n\nWe ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks \"How many more do you want?\".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.\n\nI got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!\n\nIt wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.     \n\nI might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition.",

I was a fan of the last place and the only person to ever write a review on it :(  The menu seems to be about the same as the last with a couple of additions to the sides menu and some pretty good food combos for 2 or more.  \n\nIt was July 4th.  I left work late and we didn't feel like firing up the grill.  My initial plan was to just go pick up Famous Dave's but ended up taking a quick right while driving west on Flamingo due to this overpowering smell of barbecued meat!  What the heck right?  Better off supporting a local mom and pop place than a megachain anyways.  \n\nI ordered the combo of baby back ribs slab, 20 hot wings and 2 large sides for $24.99.  The slab of ribs with 2 small sides was almost $20 so this was a no brainer for $5 more.  The ribs were pretty awesome.  They had a fantastic smokey flavor to them that one could only get by slow cooking those babies all day.  Wings were pretty standard.  About the same as any other pizza joint in town but good enough.  \n\nThe cashier recommended the red beans and rice along with the macaroni salad for sides which were both spot on.\n\nAlready planning on getting the brisket and pulled pork for my next order!",

    "text": "First order (February 2013): I picked up a Russo's special which was topped with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions.  The pizza was mediocre all the way and we were in no rush to order from here again.  \n\nSecond order (September 2013): We had last minute guests coming over to watch the Sunday afternoon football games.  Since this is the closest pizza to my house, I gave it another shot and ordered a large sausage mushroom for pickup.  This pizza was actually pretty great.  Even our guests thought so and I was pleasantly surprised.  I couldn't believe this was the same place to be honest.  \n\nThird order (November 2013): An old buddy living in Boston was raving about chicken parm sandwiches around the Fenway area.  So that got me thinking to the last time I had a great chicken parm sub which was probably when Clinton was president.  I bit the bullet and got one to go.  Although the bread was decent, the chicken was bland and under seasoned as was the tomato sauce.  It was pretty blah overall.  The sub came with a small side of potato salad that was FROZEN.  My initial thought was that the crunch in my mouth was celery but it was ice!  Nice!  \n\nI called to inform them of this and the cashier simply just said \"Sorry.\"  The owner called me 3 minutes later to apologize again.  He said there was something wrong with his fridge, everything froze over and blamed his cook for not noticing.\n\nI'll probably end up ordering from here again due to proximity but will drive that extra few miles to get pizza elsewhere for sure.  I wonder how many pizza chefs they have?  Maybe I need to obtain their shift schedule.",

    "text": "This is the best burger I've had for under $10.\n\nI think In N Out is one of the most overrated things in life.  I don't get it!  My wife loves it and could eat there twice a week no problem and I've had my fair share of bites.  I just don't see what the hype is about.  No doubt the price is better along with their fries but I'm not coming here for that.\n\nIn my world, a great burger always has a ton of toppings and ordering your burger \"all the way\" is the only way to go.  These patties are super juicy and taste fantastic.  I also love the melty, oozy greatness of the cheese is put in between the 2 patties.  \n\nOn a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.  \n\nNow I have 2 unhealthy vices that I might have to indulge in once a month.  This and Nothing Bundt Cakes!",

    "text": "Not sure how legit the reviews are so far but good job getting me to check this place out. Third restaurant in this location since TSq opened? Good luck!! I was a fan of both previous businesses. \n\nWe just made it for the end of happy hour and they were nice enough to let us slide a couple of minutes longer to choose our appetizers. All the happy hour apps were $2 a piece. Pretty sweet price. We got $3 glasses of Newcastle Werewolf beer. Never had that before and it was a very good brew. \n\nHappy hour apps: \n\nWe got the beef sliders which were different. The patties were battered and deep fried. It was certainly juicy but then again how could a deep fried hamburger patty be any other way? I prefer regular sliders though. Do Brits really do it this way? \n\nGot a mini chicken pot pie and steak pot pie. These were decent. My wife preferred beef pot pie with ground beef but I liked it with a whole piece of steak. Good flavor and something I would definitely get again. \n\nThe chips were the most disappointing. They came with a curry dip that was too mild and watery. The fries were served so rare that we actually sent them back!! I have NEVER sent back fries in my life. And in a place that's supposedly British???? Unreal. 2nd batch of fries were acceptable but still very meh. \n\nThis place has lots of promise though. The breakfast menu looked yummy and the weekday lunch deal could be a knockout. For lunch, you get an entree and then for $5 more you can get all you can drink British beer. That sounds like a heckuva fun midday! They have a $10 bottomless offer for mimosa, bloody mary's and bellinis for breakfast but its only for 9am-11am.  Still decent and a better drink deal than anywhere else nearby.  Their Sunday roast which starts in a couple of weeks could be great too. \n\nThe English afternoon tea time is something that should be targeted to moms with kids or maybe guys that drink with their pinky sticking out. How about more than just 1 TV in the place? A whole TV schedule of soccer perhaps? \n\nI feel bad about this 2 star review only because the staff was really friendly and personable.  But I have to call it like I see it.  I hope to bump it up a star on my next visit.  I know I'll be back for the bottomless beer lunch one of these days.    \n\nConclusion: Maybe this is British.  But I like the Crown and Anchor kind of British much, much more with darts, jukebox, more TV's, the occasional stupid wanker patron and better chips.",

    "text": "Opened up by the former head chef of Sushi Roku @ Caesars, Chef Kiichi is introducing a whole new Japanese niche of food to LV. My wife and I have done many an omakase at Sushi Roku with Kiichi creating so many amazing dishes so we were positive his very own restaurant would be a smash.   \n\nI lived in Japan for 2 years and the atmosphere here is definitely one of the top 2 \"feels like I'm in Japan\" places in LV with Ichiza being the other. All the dishes you would expect from a kissaten are here so we dug in.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissaten\n\nWe started by splitting the chef salad which came with a great dressing along with a complimentary side of macaroni gratin. The gratin was so tasty! It was like one the best mac and cheeses I've ever had. We were actually scraping the burnt cheese parts on the side of the bowl. \n\nEntrees were the hamburger steak and tororin omelet (see pics). Both were excellent with a couple of twists to the dishes I hadn't had before. The hamburger steak was mixed with rice instead of bread crumbs and still worked awesome. The ketchup on the omrice wasn't your typical bottled stuff and complimented the fluffiness of the eggs and the oh so good chicken fried rice. \n\nDinner was a little late for us so we didn't have a chance to try the pudding or chocolate parfait desserts since they were out by the time we were done. Just another great excuse to come back! \n\nI'm not a coffee drinker but this is a must go place if you are. Siphon coffee is this whole crazy process of coffee thing I'm unable to explain but you got to check it out. My wife was able to try the hot and iced and loved them both. There's quite different flavor to each of them. \n\nThe chef mentioned he's getting a full liquor license which will open up a whole new bunch of menu options including serving dishes that go better with alcohol.  This place is going to get even better in the future!  \n\nGood lord..how long is the wait going to be for a table here in 6 months??  I cringe.  We better go back asap.",

One of the females then said \"This is our favorite restaurant in town!  Everything is always great!\".  She then grabs all the business cards sitting by the cashier and walks out the door saying \"We have GOT to get you some more business!\".\n\nI stared at the takeout menu for a good 15 minutes.  It's freakin Chinese food!  I know what I like!!  I didn't know what was taking me so long but I ended up ordering the ma po tofu and house special lo mein.  I then think about how I can't remember the last time I ordered ma po tofu to go as I'm driving home.\n\nNOW I REMEMBER why I don't.  Everything in the takeout bag was a total mess of sauce.  I won't make that mistake again.  The tofu dish was great.  They used ground chicken instead of pork which made it taste a bit lighter than usual and the rest of the sauce that stayed in the container was pretty good.  \n\nThe noodles on the other hand were sub par.  I wish I had read Clint B's review before making the order.  I totally agree with his opinion on the lo mein and wouldn't order it again.  Excessive oil.  Chef's gone wild!\n\nI fully plan on coming back for the Peking duck which will most likely change my whole opinion of this place.",

They're usually the last on our list of fast food choices but we couldn't resist checking this place out for food creativity sake. \n\nWe got a chili cheese dog, a bulgogi dog using the vegetarian dog and the angry kimchi fries. My order of the bulgogi with vegetarian wiener seemed to perplex them so they let me know bulgogi was beef. I just didn't feel like having certain cow parts that evening :) \n\nBoth dogs were really tasty. The bun wasn't a run of the mill and bought at Costco bun which made it feel more gourmet. I loved the flavor of the angry kimchi fries but I would've preferred regular potato over sweet. \n\nThe staff and owner were really nice. They had made an extra bread pudding by mistake and gave it to us for free. The owner told us they make their pudding out of the 2 day old buns they buy direct from a local bakery in town. We had never tried it before since bread pudding always seemed like a way too heavy over the top kind of dessert in restaurants (bread before the entree....and after??) but liked the sweet caramel flavor of this pretty dense \"cake\".\n\nBottom line is if you love hot dogs, you will love this place.",

    "text": "I had a Travelzoo deal so for $36 we got 2 glasses of wine, 2 small plates, 2 medium plates and 1 large plate or a paella.  It's still available so that would be worth getting if you're coming here because I don't think it's really worth full price.  \n\nA lot of Yelpers recommended the ribs but \"dammit it if I am getting that here!\" I said to myself!  I should've done that instead of the \"chorizo and filet stuffed mushrooms\" which were awful.  3 pieces for a retail price of $9 and it tasted like they stuffed the mushrooms with Slim Jims.  While that may sound tasty to someone who just ripped 3 hits from a bong, I wasn't down with that today.  \n\nAside from that, everything else was meh to average.  The shrimp kabobs were a hearty portion compared to other plates so I would recommend that.  But if you're actually paying $9 for it, Shish Kabob House is right up the street and you'd get a huge meal for $1 more.\n\nThe cheese and chorizo empanadas were a one and done for me.  It tasted like a below average taco sealed shut.  The boquerones which had hard boiled egg tartar, peppers, anchovies on a baguette would've been better if the bread were fresh.  The paella had a good amount of veggies and seafood in it but the sauce tasted like tomato paste out of a can.  It was very, very ketchup like. \n\nThe best part was actually the chocolate torta with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  \n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive and I liked the piano man singing that night.  It made for some nice ambiance.  I would consider going back but just for happy hour.  It could also be that my wife and I ordered all the wrong things and should've stuck with non-Spanish menu items like sliders, ribs and tacos.",

    "text": "I was prepared to not love it here based on a bunch of low ratings from respected Yelpers.  But their Tuesday happy hour from 3pm-8pm which included $2 draft beers, half off all the appetizers, $2 off all specialty cocktails AND THEN buy one get one free burgers from 1pm-5pm could not be passed up!\n\nSo commenced our one meal day at 4:30pm to a mostly deserted restaurant.  I was bummed when \"Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza\" closed down at this location about a year ago.  They've kept the same set up and it was a nice enough day to open up the front bar area to the patio so we sat there.  \n\nThanks to other reviews, we were aware that the burgers were kind of small so we went with the \"more to love\" size but it came off looking like a standard size burger.  We didn't opt for fries since they wanted regular price ($5) for them.  \n\nWhy get fries when you can get the \"mac and cheese nom noms\" for $2.50?  These babies were five stars by themselves.  Those cubes of breaded and deep fried macaroni and cheese had to be one of the best appetizers I've ever had.  Total bang for buck.  We had two orders!\n\nOn to the burgers, I went with the \"I Love Bacon\" which was a blend of sirloin and applewood bacon patty with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, smoked gouda and onion strings on top.  No point in going half assed on burgers when you can go all the way!  Maybe they should finish off the plate with a syringe full of liquid bacon fat stuck on top of the burger.   Unfortunately, the brioche bun was kinda dry and the patty came off that way as well but I figured all the applewood bacon in the patty made it so.  Not great but I'm fine with paying $4.50 for it.  \n\nMy wife got the standard burger which was a little more well done than she preferred.  We didn't realize until later that this was the only \"upscale\" burger place that didn't ask us how we wanted the patty done.  Kinda weird.  Again, this burger wouldn't be worth it at regular price but it was acceptable for the hh price.  \n\nThe bartenders as well as the rest of the staff were friendly.  I would only come back here for the noms and $2 beer on Tuesdays.  Any happy hour that goes until 8pm is an excellent one.  2 stars if I were dining here during \"regular priced\" hours but it must be bumped up 1 if not 1.5 more stars for the great deal.",

Give me a cowboy hat, boots with spurs, Wrangler jeans and turn up the George Strait because I'm on the Dom DeMarco bandwagon!!\n\nThanks to My T. and others for such great reviews.  That made this a no brainer after cashing in some bet tickets at Red Rock.  \n\nWe started with the eggplant pizzettes which were 3 discs of breaded, fried goodness topped with pamesan, ricotta cheese and tomato sauce.  These were delicious even though $9 for 3 pieces seemed a little steep but not a big deal.  \n\nMediterranean salad was good enough for 4 people and was full of olives, olives, olives.  We felt it necessary to down a few more veggies before the pizza came out.\n\nI never made it to Di Fara's in Brooklyn, NY but thankfully Mr. Demarco gives us a taste of what we've been missing out on.  WOW.  We went with the Quattro Formaggio with mozzarella, provolone, romano, white cheese and tomato sauce and it knocked my face off.  The crust was perfect.  If this pizza were a punch, it would be Mike Tyson's right uppercut.  \n\nLooking forward to trying the rest of the menu when I'm back eating meat.  I might shop for some leather chaps while I'm at it.",

I wouldn't recommend Woonam Jung for a group larger than 2 since we found the grill to be too small for a party of 4 (3 of them who consistently eat their dinner like they just got out of prison).   Lots of waiting around to make more space on these small grills and then waiting for it to be done.  I prefer the bigger grills at Honey Pig.  \n\nI also didn't like how long it took for the beers to come out.  We had to ask twice for 2 reorders.  It was Hite beer so all they had to do was crack open the bottles and walk them over.  It wasn't like they were slammed the night we were there.  \n\nBanchan was substandard and I thought the pork belly was disappointing.  I did enjoy the ribeye, galbi, spicy chicken and spicy pork.  I liked that it was well ventilated so you didn't have to carry around Korean BBQ cologne with you the rest of the evening.  I still prefer other places down the street over this though.",

A small specialty pizza with a ton of toppings was $18 opposed to 4 slices for $24.  You can't get any more toppings than their ridiculous Miles 10 Meat pizza.  That's \"made with a bolognese mix of veal, pork, and ground beef, smothered in mozzarella cheese, and topped with prosciutto, pepperoni, pancetta, sausage, bacon, mortadella and cappacola.\"  No pizza could possibly be bad when it has all this.  It was really good.\n\n$18 for a small pizza is a little more than I want to spend but this is probably one of the cheapest places to do dinner at Mandalay Bay.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here but it's not a bad option for something casual.",

The deluxe ramen was my only choice.  I already plan on getting even more of their fantastic chashu next time.\n\nI'm not big on miso ramen.  Not that I dislike it but it's never my first choice.  The shio was great and I thoroughly enjoyed every slurp of the noodles.  My wife opted for the miso butter corn ramen, a northern Japan specialty, which she liked a lot. \n\nBased on the Yelp buzz, it was a flat out guarantee to see a Yelper in the house.  Nice seeing My and Thao T with their little, future food connoisseur in tow!\n\nSolid ramen place but I felt like my meal was incomplete without a big bottle of Asahi Super Dry (no liquor license yet?) and good gyoza.  The gyoza was below average.  I definitely like this place over Monta.  My wife refuses to step into Anime due to the manga otaku factor so I can't compare that yet.  My deluxe ramen might come out to $16 on future trips.",

We got the Jaegerschnitzel which the menu described as \"two tender 'Hunter Style' breaded pork cutlets topped with our secret mushroom gravy and served with fresh house spaetzle.\".  Man oh man was this fantastic.  The cutlets were big and very juicy.  The spaetzle was excellent too.    \n\nWe also got the \"Wurstplatte\" which was a sausage sampler that came with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut consisting of two of each of their 3 homemade sausages.  Interestingly enough, my favorite was my wife's least fave.  I really enjoyed the \"bockwurst\" which was their white sausage flavor the best, she preferred the beer bratwurst.  No problem then..more for me!  \n\nThe apple streudel on display looked damn good so we got one of those too.  I really liked the doughyness of it.  \n\nI am holding out on 5 stars til they get a liquor license and I can guzzle some steins of beer with their delicious food.  Anybody out there in Yelpworld got some pull?  The owner said she's been waiting for 9 months already.  \n\nThey also have a dinner buffet the first Saturday of every month.  Count on us being there Dec 1st!",

    "text": "Short review: This is the best steakhouse in Vegas right now.  I have been to every other place in town and Gordon Ramsay Steak is #1 with a bullet!  Carnevino? Botero? Cut? Stripsteak? Old Homestead? They've all taken a backseat.\n\nLonger review:\n\nI made a reservation a month in advance for my wife's birthday as this is probably the hottest restaurant on the strip at the moment.  We had heard so many great things and were already foaming at the mouth as we circled the faux Arc de Triomphe.\n\nThe entrance was cool.  Is this what modern London restaurants look like?  I wouldn't know since I'd just eat Indian if I were there.  All the hostesses looked like they were ready to redo Robert Palmer's \"Addicted to Love\" video at a drop of a hat.  Now that everyone under 25 years old has no idea what I am referring to...on to the food!\n\nWe had drinks at the bar while we waited for the table.  I got a gin martini which was accompanied by a very tasty green olive stuffed with bacon and cheese and the wife got the \"English Garden\" cocktail.  That was a terrific drink as well and very refreshing.  The Ipad cocktail menus were neat to zip through and certainly beat flipping pages.  \n\nFinally get seated, order a bottle of red and the wife goes with the \"Sonoma Farms Foie Gras\" with strawberry jam, bacon bits and buttered slices of English muffin.  WOWOWOWOW!  I've eaten some duck liver in my life but never like this.  Whoever came up with this creation deserves an award!  I'd like to have this for breakfast 3 times a week.  How many points is this on Weight Watchers?  \n\nI went with the \"Maine Lobster\" which was stuffed with chorizo, poached in butter with cream and corn.  That was great as well but all I wanted to do was trade it in for more foie gras.  \n\nMy wife always gets filet mignon so I was prepared to get the beef wellington but she threw me a curve and actually went wellington.  I knew that the famed butcher Pat LaFrieda from NYC provided all the beef cuts here.  Great meat for sure but we had been to Old Homestead not too long before and thought it might taste kind of the same.  How freakin wrong I was!!  I was ridiculously taken aback upon my first bite of the ribeye.  This is the same cut of ribeye that Old Homestead gets?  Really??  It was mindblowing how different it was seasoned and prepared.  I was in a beef trance and loved every bite.  My wife really liked the beef wellington and the one bite I had was scrumptious but I was too wrapped up in the monster cut in front of me to focus on anything else :P\n\nWe had the standard creamed spinach and mac & cheese for sides and both were done perfectly.  Service was A+ too.  Too full for dessert.  \n\nOther notes:\n\n- I stopped watching \"Hell's Kitchen\" a few years ago since it seemed like the same season every year but the winner from the most recent season started at the restaurant last week.  She was open to photos and autographs to whoever wanted them.  \n\n- Ordering fish at a place that specializes in steak is like ordering a hamburger in a Chinese restaurant.  I don't get it.\n\n- Don't forget your Caesars Entertainment players card.  You'll save a wee bit on dinner.",

We ended up going to both and this one was not the \"champion\".  \n\nI would consider Taiwan Kitchen to be a dive based on the dirty floors and below average tables, chairs and booths.  That's not a deal breaker for me since ambiance isn't what we're here for.  We ended up splitting 4 entrees. \n\nTofu Basil: Totally delicious and the best dish we had.  They prepared it like three cup chicken but it was even better because the tofu was nice and crispy.  The sauce was really good and went perfectly with rice.  I would come back just for this dish alone.  \n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup: It was decent but we all agreed that the other place was champ.  The beef wasn't as tender as it should be.  It also wasn't that spicy.  \n\nPork chop with rice: It's hard to mess this one up and it was a solid dish that would've been a complete lunch or dinner for almost anyone not named Tony T.  \n\nThick Pork Noodle Soup: I didn't mind this but neither my parents nor my wife cared for it that much.  \n\nThey also offered \"Japanese style ramen\" but since when did Japanese start putting fried chicken in their ramen?  I am certainly curious.  We'll be back for the tofu basil and give some other plates a shot.",

The look on my face after my first bite of toro rivaled Arnold Schwarzenegger's face in \"Total Recall\" when his eyes were popping out.  Would've been a classic profile picture!\n\nI did the omakase and everything was great.  I plan on just getting the nigiri courses and then just ordering additional nigiri since that's all I want the next time.  Maybe an order of toro with a side of chu-toro.  \n\nMake your reservation on Tuesday or Friday since they get their fish shipments from Tokyo on those days.",

    "text": "I dig faux vegetarian meats and Veggie House exceeded all my expectations.  My buddy reluctantly agreed to meet here for dinner since I am pretending to be vegetarian for the month.  It's a good thing we got here a little before 6pm on a Tuesday because every table was taken in 30 minutes with even more people waiting to be seated.  I can't think of another 2nd floor plaza restaurant doing business this brisk except for Ichiza.  Good for them!\n\nGeneral Tso's (or Tzo or Tsao or Zao or whateverthefuck) chicken was as close as you could get to the real deal and the unanimous favorite dish.  We annihilated it.  We also got the Mongolian beef which was gluten/tofu heaven and the spicy, crispy eggplant was deeeeeelightful.  \n\nI also had the honor of esteemed Yelper, Tony T, stopping by to say hello.  He said he preferred the seafood dishes over the others.  That kind of surprised me for some reason but I will definitely go for some of those next time.  How does one make vegetarian scallop in the first place?\n\nThis is Chinese vegetarian heaven!  They even do ramen for chrissakes!",

This stuff kills me.  The fashion, the songs, the 40 person singing groups, definitely nothing I normally watch so it's a great way to pass the time while they're making your drink.\n\nIt's all just soooo welcoming and kind of makes you want to stay a while unlike most boba joints in town.

    "text": "Misti and My T's reviews ensured my next dinner out was going to be here.  It was Monday night and we were the only ones in the dining area at 8pm but that didn't stop Mrs. Q from greeting us warmly.  \n\nBobby had a seat with us and gave us the breakdown of his place and a little history behind their whole operation.  I hadn't done their food truck since I pretty much don't do trucks and was glad to finally try the famous \"Sin City Wings\" and some mighty tasty dishes you can't find executed this well anywhere else in town.  The two of them run the whole kitchen on Monday nights, no other staff.  I thought this was great because they would make the food the best since they were the architects of the menu.  \n\nBefore our orders came out, Bobby gave us a sample of their brisket and \"OH MAN\" that was almost the highlight of the meal.  Hummanah hummanah I am getting this next time for sure!  We got the fried pickles which were great and also a big enough serving for 4 so those were our \"greens\" for dinner :P  Also got a pound of wings with the Bobby Q. and hot buffalo sauce on the side but next time we'll just get the wings tossed in a sauce.  The Bobby Q. sauce was pretty unique.  It was a lot more tomatoey than most and would've gone great with a lot of different things including burgers and even fries.  I didn't ask if I could buy a bottle but I will on a future visit.  \n\nShrimp and grits were amazing.  The shrimp was perfectly grilled and I am not a southern boy so I am usually not feeling the grits but I dug out every little bit of grit out of the jar it was served in.  \n\nThen the dessert or should I say \"jarssert\"!  Their strawberry jellocake with whipped cream in a mason jar was fanfuckingtastic.  So rich, sweet and the whipped cream was definitely homemade and perfect.  When Mrs. Q asked how it was, I asked her how many sticks of butter were in this.  She said no butter!  HOW??  I must find out the secret.  Wow!  We were floored.  \n\nIt's a great menu.  I can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "How good is it when the best thing on the menu is the peach cobbler??  That's definitely worth trying above anything else.  It might be even worth buying a whole tin of it.  I would!!\n\nI wasn't impressed with the rest of it.  We got 12 wings.  Half of it was extra hot and the other was garlic parmesan which was recommended by the person working.  It had a ton of grated (sawdust) parmesan on top which was pretty lame.  The wings were just wings.  Nothing special to me.  The baked beans side was really good and the potato salad was decent but that doesn't equal a complete dinner.  The red velvet cake wasn't as good as before either.  It was definitely dry and there were no chocolate chips in it like last time.  \n\nConsidering the atmosphere of the dining area (this would be an ideal place for illegal transactions to go down) or other things lacking like clean tables AND the fact that Wing King doesn't have one of the best things to drink with wings (BEER), I am a takeout customer at best.  \n\nCall in your order if you don't like waiting.",

    "text": "I just HAD to come here because the photos of the pides looked so damn good!  \n\nWe would normally go to Elements since it's in the same plaza but my wife and I just wanted something quick and relatively inexpensive.  Not sure how many reviews as of now are legit but again...look at those pides!\n\nStaff was really welcoming and friendly right off the bat.  We went with the Italian pide which tasted as good as it looked.  Lots of sauce, meat and flavor.  I'll try the Greek one next time.  \n\nThe sandwiches were pretty interesting and not run of the mill.  We tried the \"Ham & Cheese Please\" which included local smoked ham, gruyere cheese, blueberries, Funions, chili mayo on panini grilled country bread.  More sandwiches should have Funions in them!  Who knew?  Yum yum.  \n\nThey had 6 or 7 salads to choose from and we went with the tandoori chicken, mango, coconut which was OK.  I thought the chicken could've been more tandoori-y if that makes any sense.  The Israeli couscous, wild mushrooms, parmesan and lemon truffle was decent but that was more of the wife's choice since I'm not into the whole liquid chemical truffle thing.  \n \nThe quality of the smoothie itself was great.  Definitely on par with Whole Foods or Greens and Proteins.\n\nOverall a solid place though.  A great place for lunch or a quick dinner.",

    "text": "Eating at a buffet is all about choices and 500+ items automatically makes it 5 stars and the greatest daily buffet in Vegas history.  If you can't find at least 25 things you enjoy here, you might want to consider seeking professional help.  \n\nThey really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza, sushi, and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas, lamb chops, ribeye, ramen, kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  \n\nAvoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  \n\nBravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!",

    "text": "I bought a Travelzoo coupon where for $49 you got any 2 appetizers (up to $16 each), 2 entrees (up to $26 each)  and 2 alcoholic beverages (up to $13 each). Basically you could get anything on the menu so obviously went with the highest priced items.  I was going to save this for one weekend during the NFL playoffs but the fridge was empty and it was Falcons vs Lions on Saturday so what the heck.  There were plenty of TV's and a decent place to see a game.  \n\nFirst appetizer was the buffalo shrimp consisting of 4 breaded and fried pieces of shrimp with a good kick.  My wife loved this and I know we'll be back just for this dish.  I also got the cheesesteak egg rolls after inhaling multiple pieces of these after Misti's CMYE: Bodies event.  They were outstanding and as good as I remember although $3 a piece seemed kind of high.\n\nFilet mignon sliders ($25) were really good.  We both expected just \"ground filet mignon\" but those babies were just straight pieces of tender, juicy filet nestled in between some tasty buns.  I was surprised how good the steak was for being much smaller than your average filet.  \n\nLast and definitely least was the \"French Quarter Jambalaya\".  It was a boring sauce with dry chicken breast with the shrimp being the highlight.  I think a real Cajun/Creole place serving jambalaya would try this and break out in sheer laughter.  \n\nI got the Goose Island Nero Belgium Ale ($12) which had to be north of 9% because I was feeling it after one.  My wife ordered the pomegranate martini ($13) which she said was fine.  \n\nWe got a $100 dinner for $49 before gratuity and this was certainly not a dinner worth that price. I would stop by for happy hour and just do appetizers and drinks.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.",

    "text": "Yes!!  I found it.  The shittiest PT's in Las Vegas!  The search is finally over.  What a relief.  \n\nI come here a few Sundays a year because for some ridiculous reason, there are no New England Patriots bars in town and a bunch of fans congregate here for the games.  Those people make it fun, but I'd definitely go more often if the venue were better.    \n\nYou might say \"I've been to several shitty PT's.  How bad could it be?\"\n\nFirst, they're regularly out of most beers.  I'm not talking Sam Adams seasonal; I'm talkin Miller fuckin Lite.  \n\nHere's a typical conversation:\n\nMe: I'll have a Guinness.\n\nBartender:  We're out.\n\nMe:   Stella?\n\nBartender:  Out.\n\nMe: Horse urine?\n\nBartender:  Coors Light is all we have on tap right now.\n\nMe: OK.  Give me the large.\n\nHow does the biggest chain of bars in Clark County forget to stock basic things like domestic beer?  Does the delivery person accidentally bypass this specific location??  I wouldn't blame them.  It has been open for well over a year, yet they still sport red and white vinyl signage.  I could imagine the corporate meeting regarding this bar: \"If it becomes profitable, we should put a white van in the parking lot and have it say 'BAR' with an arrow pointing left to increase exposure.\"\n\nThen there's the food.  Pizza is 50% off during happy hour.  After ordering, the bartender (on her own free will) said \"It's pretty good unless you're snooty about pizza or from the east coast.\"  Well, gollygeekickmeinthenutswhiz, how could I not be pumped up now??  Upon first bite, safe to say it was pizza like none I'd had before.  It was a disgrace.  When the cook gets an order for this barely edible disc, the recipe card probably says:\n\n1. Get cardboard \n2. Add \"canned red sauce\", \"pepperoni product\" and \"cheese product\"\n3. No need to heat\n4. Serve\n\nIf that weren't enough, people can smoke to their dying heart's content here.  I've seen patrons leave the bar by halftime since it got so goddamn smoky.  Not sure why this is allowed.  Marge Simpson's sisters would give this place 5 stars.",

    "text": "If I ever need my fix for J-curry, this is where I'll go from now on.  Apparently that's also the case for many Japanese in town including the owner of Cafe de Japon who we bumped into and had the pleasure of dining with.  He got natto with his curry.  I didn't know that was something Japanese did?  I think natto is super gross but I guess drowning it in rich curry sauce would be the most acceptable way for me to scarf it down.  \n\nMost of the meat options are breaded and fried with the exception of the kurobuta sausage.  I got the pork katsu with cheese and my wife went with chicken katsu and cheese.  Both were excellent and terrific portions.  I also liked how they offered almonds, raisins, sweet onions and pickles on the side.  I'd never put almonds on my curry before but it made for great texture.  I ate a ton of onions since that went really well with the crunch and juiciness of the pork.    \n\nI would like to see a few more options for curry including a straight up beef option and maybe an unfried chicken too but that's not a big thing.  Friendly service, Japaneezy atmosphere and great curry is what will ensure my return.  Free wifi is a plus.",

    "text": "It's pretty close to 3.75 stars.  \n\nThey offer a few dishes most AYCE sushi joints don't like ribeye Big Wong style, fresh oysters,  and kushiyaki (meat on a stick) options like bacon wrapped scallops.  It's actually a good place to bring that one friend who dislikes sushi.  I also like the all you can drink beer/wine/sake option for $10 more but they said they're going to change it next month.  Ummm....why??  \n\nThis location used to be Kaizen and you can definitely tell from the look of the place.  Interesting mix of old and modern and the long tables definitely encourage groups to stay a while.  We sat at the bar to pick the chefs brain on recommendations.  The whole staff was Korean.  Not too much of a big deal for me.  \n\nSushi standouts were the halibut and super white tuna nigiri.  The chef, Alex, said it was the freshest fish they had and it was great.  There were a ton of great options if you like cream cheese, rolls deep fried or something in unagi sauce.  I am not one of those people but knock yourself out a la Drago vs Creed if you are.  Basic rolls were fine and the freshness was acceptable.    \n\nI was really intrigued that they offered both miso and tonkotsu ramen.  I just HAD to try half a bowl of tonkotsu made by Koreans.  The noodles, broth and 2 big pieces of pork belly were pretty good but it wasn't exactly Japanese ramen.  Koramen?  Alex took pride in the fact he made the broth from scratch as he should..it was tasty but not Japanese by any means.  \n\nService was definitely on top of things.  There were 3 waiters checking on us throughout the meal and earned their gratuity.",

I saw cheese, onions and chili on a hot dog and it was devoured in less than 30 seconds.  I had some chili land on my sneaker as a parting gift although I am not sure it came from my dog.  \n\n25 seconds didn't fully allow me to take the time and analyze the complex flavors of this \"world famous\" hot dog.  But considering my state at the time, if I had really liked it, I definitely would've gotten another one.  I am not a big hot dog person.  It would be my last choice of food at any sporting event or bbq.  I'll reserve Hofman's hot dogs of Syracuse, NY as the best one I've ever had and this was average.  Not many other hot dog options on Fremont but I'd rather do Mermaids for their atmosphere :P",

I could've been somewhere on Smith Street in Brooklyn stepping in here.  \n\nOur server had some recommendations (maybe since we were taking too long making a decision) and the one we went with was freakin awesome.  The Sen Mee Kang Pou which was a homemade crab curry with thin rice noodle was a slam dunk for both my wife and I.  She said it was one of the best Thai dishes she's ever had and I have to agree.  If everything the waiter recommended was this good then I would have had him pick everything.  \n\nWe also tried the Miang Pou.  That was a lettuce wrap with crab meat, ginger, roasted coconut, peanut, chili, lime and onion.  Nice starter and I liked how the filling was arranged in the lettuce to where you get the crab and spice at the end of it.  It was kind of like an appetizer money shot if you will.  \n\nThe final dish was the green curry which I wasn't too into getting.  My wife always wants it but I was sure glad we ended up having it because it was terrific. The curry had grilled pork, bamboo shoots and eggplant.  The sauce was really good but the pork was cooked perfectly.  It was so tender and tasty that it made the whole dish for me.  That's a protein I never consider for Thai curry but I definitely would now. \n\nSure they have all the usual items any Thai restaurant does but I don't think that's what you should come here for.  Pad Thai schmad Thai yaaawwwwwn.  Quail eggs, Chilean sea bass, lobster and some of the more creative dishes is what I look forward to trying on future visits.",

    "text": "I believe this is the most expensive Mexican restaurant in Vegas (yes...$20 for a quesadilla) but at least I know where my money went!  \n\nMy wife and I were kindly seated in one of the cool booths which gave us a great view of those amazing wood carvings of the dead.  I'd love to know how much they actually cost.  \n\nWe were in a rush to catch Zarkana so we didn't dilly dally with any appetizers but the salsa that came with the chips was muy delicioso.  My wife ordered the \"Cabo Azul\" which was basically a seafood combo.  The most eyecatching thing in the combo was the lobster enchilada but it turned out to be just OK.  The grilled chile relleno which was really big and stuffed with cheese, shrimp, crab and topped with tomatillo sauce was mouthfuls of awesomeness.  They actually served the shrimp taco on a separate plate and that was very good too.  \n\nI ordered the carnitas based on the waiter recommendation.  I didn't know what to expect since the priciest carnitas I'd ever had before this was $12.  But I was pleasantly surprised when he brought it over.  The plate featured 3 parts of the pig including ribs, tenderloin and shoulder.  SOO good!  The waiter informed me that the pork is marinated for 24 hours, deep fried and then finished in an oven.  If KFC started frying pork, it would kind of taste like this.  The was crispy, tender and juicy all at once.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.  \n\nThis was a very enjoyable meal overall.  We both wished we could have stayed longer.  The atmosphere, food preparation, service and strong drinks will ensure our return.",

    "text": "By no means am I a soul food expert but if the dish is fried, covered in gravy or sauce or all the above then COUNT ME IN.\n\nIt was pretty busy when we walked in on a Tuesday night.  They had the soul classics blaring through the speakers while the Lakers were on TV with their new lineup was tanking it against the Mavericks.  So far, so good!\n\nTheir menu offered all the soul offerings you would expect like fried chicken, ribs, fried catfish and all the usual suspects for sides.  My wife opted for the smothered chicken ($14) which was fried chicken drenched in gravy.  That was excellent.  The gravy was really good but we would consider ordering fried chicken with a side of gravy so we could enjoy the crisp of the chicken which was nonexistent post smothering.  \n\nI opted for the turkey wings ($14) which consisted of 2 big assed baked turkey wings smothered in gravy.  Even though the gravy was the same for both, they tasted quite different based on the preparation of the meat.  \n\nYou get 3 sides per entree unless you get chicken and waffles.  3 sides is more than enough and all the ones we tried were on point.  That included collard greens in some amazing sauce, delectably sweet sweet potatoes, red rice and beans with great sausage flavor and the mac+cheese.  The cornbread they gave was in pancake form and went terrific with syrup.\n\nNo free refills on drinks and they charge $1.50 for water so you might as well get sweet tea, Kool Aid or lemonade for $2.\n\nBreakfast menu also looked damn good.  I'd like to try that out sometime too.",

    "text": "The original plan was to grab a drink since we had dinner reservations later at a place that rhymed with \"Sonny Halt\".  But the wine and atmosphere was so cool and unVegas plus the menu looked so damn tempting and inviting that we just said screw it and settled in for dinner here. The live music trio they had performing was great and really enhanced the dining.\n\nMy favorite dish by far was the lamb shoulder.  It was slow cooked, very tender and the yogurt sauce that accompanied it was perfect.  The risotto was decent.  We weren't that into the grilled cheese.  Even though it was quite different than the average grilled cheese with brie, honey and walnuts, I didn't feel it justified the $7 price.  The 5 onion soup was above average.  Our bartender strongly recommended the cobbler for dessert and it was great.  \n\nThere are a lot of other things we definitely want to try that sounded scrumptious like chicken pot pie nuggets and the pork belly flatbread.  The menu they have posted online is dated as there's more to choose from than what's posted.  \n\nI didn't really like how the dining tables were set up.  Neighboring tables were very, very close to one another.  It's as if you were dining with them.  They have the space to open it up a little more.  We chose the bar which was definitely better for couples.  So come as 2 at the bar or 5+ so you can take up a whole table section.  \n\nThey also have a happy hour at their wine and cheese bar from 5pm-8pm which includes $2 glasses of wine among other things.  I actually have a reason to go to Tivoli Village now!  Wow!  That only took a year and a half :)",

It came out hot, rich and salty (insert perverted joke here). I honestly could have had another order since I scarfed down the bowl in seconds flat.  Fortunately, my friend ordered a small chashu bowl as an appetizer which left me satiated.  \n\nThey NEED to get the gyoza going.  Just this past week alone I have been to a German restaurant that didn't serve beer and now a ramen restaurant with no gyoza.  They said their gyoza machine is down and will be up soon.  I wasn't sure whether the machine made them or cooked them but I wasn't up for questions when hot ramen is staring right at me.  At least they had beer.  \n\nTesturo P. said \"You should try the Tan Tan Men next time, it is the best thing in the world.\".  So that's what I am going to do.",

Atmosphere was pretty cool and the service at the bar was fine.\n\nWe went with the classic meatballs with spicy tomato sauce (not spicy) and mozzarella and also got an order of 3 beef meatballs with mushroom sauce topped with provolone and fried egg.  The cheese and egg are a dollar extra and each bowl of meatballs comes with a piece of bread.  We also ordered the \"garbage salad\" which was a nice mix of salami, cheese, olives and the other usual suspects.  \n\nThe meatballs themselves were damn good.  The classic was very tender with it being a mix of pork, veal and beef.  The beef meatballs were a lot more solid and went well with the mushroom sauce.  We both wished there was more bread with the orders and asked for an extra piece which they kindly gave at no extra charge.  Maybe the meatball sandwich is what I'd get next time.  \n\nIt was also kind of weird to just have meatballs as a main course for dinner.  This seems like a snack place for me. Or you could go with splitting an order of meatballs and go for more sides like pasta, risotto or vegetables instead.\n\nI am not sure if they have happy hour but it sounds like something that would be a big hit here.",

    "text": "We walked in here without a reservation on a Saturday night and ate at the bar.  I am super late on the Honey Salt bandwagon.  So much so that I might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called \"Breaking Bad\".  I mean, the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich has similar qualities to meth...so I've heard anyways.  \n\nThe creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  The charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  \n\nI got \"My Wife's Favorite Salad\" consisting of duck confit, arugula, fris\u00e9e, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  This was terrific and I only wished there was even more duck but I am sure everyone feels that way.  I thought the mix of flavors were really good.  \n\nWe split the Colorado Lamb porterhouse for the entree.  It came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  I'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  The lamb was a little more done than I wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  Like all good porterhouses, I found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  \n\nOur super friendly (and fellow Red Sox fan from Andover, MA) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting \"The Brookie\" for dessert which the menu describes \"chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream\".  You should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  I feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  \n\nOverall it was great.  What's not to like about this spot?",

I tried being a good husband and getting other items for variety's sake on past visits; it's my wife's favorite as well...that's over now.  \n\nThe CCNS consists of a thick, rich, hearty broth that touches my soul like Louis Armstrong singing \"What a Wonderful World\".  It's easy to taste upon the first spoonful of this glorious curryness that it's not something that can just be whipped up.  Those chickens have been simmering in broth for hours, if not days.  The generous amount of meat in the bowl makes me love it even more.  \n\nNot that there's anything wrong with their rare beef pho or those meat entrees where the grains of rice looks all cute and snuggled up under the canopy of a perfectly fried egg, but that's all vice president/runner up type stuff.  Next time I order, I plan on just saying \"Call me Obama and bring me that fucking awesome stuff in a bowl.\"",

    "text": "I had been dying to come back to Cantina Laredo after the outstanding Yelp Gold Elite dinner I attended a little over a month ago.  The plan was to pick up my wife after she got out of work and I went over to Misti's CMYE at La Belle Terre in the meantime.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) the treats they offered were really, really good and I couldn't bear to eat...just ...one.  \n\nSo I wasn't that hungry when we rolled in here.  We split an appetizer and entree.  But it looked like happy hour was truly where it was at with half price margaritas, $3 beer and half off the bar menu.  They run that from 4pm-7pm and after 9pm.  Ofcourse we're there at 7:30pm.  We made sure to order things that weren't discounted during happy hour.\n\nAppetizer: My wife's only request is that she wanted something with cheese.  What?  At a Mexican restaurant???  Are you sure???  It didn't get much cheesier than the \"Laredo Fundido\" which was a huge bowl of cheese sauce with taco meat in it.  This would be excellent to share with a group.   I would've preferred the tableside guacamole.  A lot of tables ordered it and that looked great.\n\nEntree: The \"Enchilada Mole\" was pretty good.  Mole isn't something I want to have most of the time but it sounded great and it delivered.  The sauce had good flavor and tasted like only mole could.\n\nI'll definitely be back for some of the more exciting dishes when I have more of an appetite.  The outdoor area will be great when it gets warmer too.",

    "text": "It was late, I was starving and this is the closest taco shop to my house so I decided to give it a go.  The thing that got me most excited prearrival was that they offered al pastor 24/7.  Not much can beat great al pastor and I have yet to find anything that tops my beloved (and closed down) Tacos Los Parados al pastor, so I had high hopes.  \n\nThose hopes dashed away as soon as I was at the counter and saw the pastor spinning on the spit.  It was as if it had been on there for a couple of days.  I then realized how difficult it must be to maintain quality pastor around the clock.  This is why there aren't any 24 hour shawarma joints.  Yet I was in denial and ordered 2 pastor tacos and 2 chicken tacos for $1.79 a piece to go.  \n\n10 minutes later, all 4 tacos were crammed into a foil package the size of a PB&J sandwich.  I was surprised at how small it all was that I asked the cashier \"Is this everything?\".  I get home and realized that I had just ordered the smallest tacos in the world.  \n\nI read an article a while back that the current (maybe not by the time you read this) New York Jets coach, Rex Ryan, would eat 12 tacos for dinner before he had gastric bypass.  He certainly wasn't eating these babies.  The chicken was fine and as I had expected, the pastor was dry.  Perhaps I need to go during peak hours when it's fresh?\n\nRoberto's is definitely their main competitor and in the cheap and ghetto Vegas taco game, Roberto wins.",

Here's just a few things:  \n\n- Doesn't seem like it gets very crowded often so seating is immediate\n- 3 TV's to watch games while eating as opposed to Goyemon's lonely one behind the sushi bar\n- A few unique offerings like chicken heart yakitori.  I really like chicken hearts a lot so I had multiple skewers and they were terrific.  \n- They also steam their shumai, gyoza and other dumplings legitimately unlike others just nuking them or whatever the heck they do.\n\nThe service was very good.  Along with tending to unfilled drinks and empty plates expeditiously, they were also nice enough to change the channel for me since no one else was watching what was on.  \n\nSome Japanese may not be down since it's Korean run but that doesn't bother me.  It would be nice if they stayed open later than 11pm but that's not a big deal.  All the fish I had was great and I will be back!",

    "text": "Situated in front of the Showtime Carwash, I had driven by this taco stand several times a week for the last month.  I am not sure exactly when they're open but definitely on Friday and Saturday nights.   \n\nAfter subpar al pastor tacos a few days before, this was a must check out.  You're clearly able to see the gigantic spit of al pastor even going by at 50 mph.  It's almost as if time stands still and you hear voices singing from the heavens!  Not really but it looked pretty fucking good.\n\nThere were 6 people in front of us with a few waiting for their orders but the cooks churned out the stuff pretty quick.  Most tacos were a $1.50 but we splurged (wink) for another 50 cents and got 2 lengua tacos along with 4 al pastor and 2 carne asada.   I was immediately psyched when the guy taking our order asked if we wanted pineapple with our pastor.  Yes.  Yes we would.  \n\nThey also offered quesadillas and burritos but we were in total taco mode.  I was impressed with the condiments they offered including 3 salsas (mild green, really spicy dark green and mild red pepper cream), very spicy onions (awesome), chopped raw onions, cilantro and radish.  They also offered grilled onions and whole jalapenos which were also free.  Most customers chose to stand and eat but we bagged everything up and ate at home.\n\nThe pastor was pretty good but not the best I've had.  The carne asada and lengua were very solid too.  We actually contemplated driving back to get a couple of more tacos. Definitely will be back.  Maybe we'll bring lawn chairs and a six pack of beer next time!  I hope they stick around.",

    "text": "Even though I am generally reluctant to dine at any of the upscale, non sushi-centric Asian restaurants on The Strip, I usually end up leaving pretty happy with the meals.  On a recent visit for my wife's birthday dinner, Andrea's continuously hit high marks, plate after plate after plate.  Yes, it costs more than Spring Mountain, but there's a quality of ingredients here that is unparalleled to most spots a few miles southwest of Encore.  \n\nThe ambiance is really nice - the cool lighting, upscale late 70's furnishings with accompanying music that dabbled into the 80's as the night went on made me feel like this was the kind of place to pregame before going to Studio 54.  Andrea Wynn's eyes all lit up behind the bar were strangely soothing.  The 3 cucumber/gin cocktails only enhanced that effect.\n\nWith a party of 8, we opted to go omakase family style.  The waiter asked for a per person price to adhere to along with any items we were not interested in (ah-hem....$9 miso soup) and then we awaited the surprises from the kitchen.  \"Seafood on Ice\" may sound like the worst ice skating show ever (ok,ok a gigantic oyster doing a triple axle might possibly awesome), but these treasures from the ocean were excellent.  The slow poached prawns were shrimp cocktail for kings, and the initial bite of the marinated bay scallop totally wowed me with its freshness.  Crab legs, oysters, Maine lobster and tuna poke made life even better.   \n\nThe \"Steamed Sea Bass\" was exquisite.  It started tender on the outside and got tendererererererer as you got to the center.  The ginger, garlic, mushroom, lemon and cilantro made for a simple but divine combination for such a fantastic cut of fish.  I bet Roger Federerererererer would like this.  Everything else was very enjoyable including the tuna+crispy rice, rock shrimp tempura, hamachi sashimi, sliced prime New York strip, adobo crab fried rice, and the Saikyo miso black cod among other items.   \n\nIt was impossible to say no to the Mt Fuji dessert.  I mean....how do you NOT take photos and videos of this behemoth of sugar as they pour the Bacardi 151 and set it on fire???  I found it to be a bit too alcohol-y for my taste, but totally worth the \"show\" factor.  It was a great ending to the meal.  Color me reluctant no more!",

    "text": "I am seriously kicking myself for not coming here during Restaurant Week.  $30 for lunch would have been a total steal compared to the bill my buddy and I received after a tremendous lunch on a sunny weekday afternoon.  But it was all worth it and I will be doing it again soon.\n\nLet's start with the awesome appetizers we had.  Everyone mentions the watermelon salad and it really is all that.  The goat cheese, oil and other seasonings that come with each piece of juicy watermelon is absolutely heavenly.  The tuna deviled eggs were good but we both felt needed some kind of cracker to put it on.  My friend was starving by the time we got there and added the kimchi fried rice to our order as our terrific server was walking away.  I enjoyed that was well.  Talk about a spectrum of flavors just for the apps!!\n\nFor entrees, I got the crispy pork belly which was the biggest portion of pork belly I'd ever had.  The fatty juiciness of the meat itself really complemented the crispy and crusty exterior.  But what really blew us away was my friend's duck dish.  Perfectly sliced pieces of duck topped with Kix cereal.  Why Kix?  Why not!  One of the best duck entrees I've ever had.  I already know I am getting that on a future visit. \n\nThey had a great cocktail menu.  Our server was explaining how she was in experimenting with a cocktail containing siracha that she wasn't ready to unleash yet .  Maybe I'll try to make it a happy hour request.  \n\nThe manager, Bex, was nice enough to show us the upstairs area before we left and that just had \"fun time\" written all over it.",

    "text": "Now that they're touting a gourmet menu that goes way beyond any Italian pie joint in the vicinity, every review before 2015 should be ignored.  You'll be doing a disservice to yourself going the traditional route of a sausage and mushroom pizza.\n\n\"Radicchio\" kicked off our meal with shaved root vegetables, herbs, and vinaigrette.  The plate wowed in its mix of color, delightful crunch of garden greens, and a bitter, acidic finish that I found surprisingly refreshing.  I could see how the bitterness could be off putting for some though.  This pummeled any lame lettuce, tomato, salad with dressing from a jar that the average pizzeria pushes out.\n\n\"Coniglio con Conchiglie\", basically a rich kid's mac and cheese, is filled with braised rabbit, sugo di formmagi, shell pasta, zucchini and coriander.  It's what initially piqued my interest to check out RCP again, and it'll be the dish that will have me coming back.  I resisted the urge to mix everything together to get more rabbit flavor, but that ended in mere minutes since the cheese sauce was so damn good.  I'd brush my teeth with that shit.\n\nThe calamari was also delicious.  The tender rings of saut\u00e9ed squid with herbed parsnip puree, eggplant and crispy shallots went marvelously together.  \n\nInstead of going with dessert, we finished with pizza slices (oink).  I so badly wanted chicken oysters which were only available as a pizza topping.  That needs to change!  Chopping up the best part of the bird isn't the ideal way to serve this.   Chicken oyster entr\u00e9e, please?",

    "text": "This past January marked a year my wife stopped smoking cigarettes.  So imagine my surprise when the one thing she wanted to do to mark the occasion was to...smoke hookah??  I personally hadn't done that in well over 6+ years.  28 reviews and counting with consistent 5 star reviews lead us to Layla.\n\nAlthough it's a small place that can cater to maybe 6 groups total, it's like a really cool guy's basement.  That really cool guy happens to also be named Guy.  He recognized my wife and I instantly since we lived in the same apartment complex a couple of years ago and had neighboring parking spots.  Throughout our visit, Guy was super friendly, attentive and made us feel very welcome.  The big leather couches you sit on INSIST that you stay a while.       \n\nWe were informed that all their food was homemade so trying the falafel and hummus appetizer was an absolute must for me.  Their falafel rivals any other joint as the best in LV, crunchy outside and flavorful green inside.  I could tell right away that the hummus was homemade.  It tasted more like a super thick tahini sauce than your average hummus but I thought it accompanied the falafel really well.  I'll be sure to get it again.  We also got an order of stuffed grape leaves and a nice basket of freshly toasted pita.  Guy also hooked us up with a couple of pieces of baklava which made for a nice ending to the meal.\n\nHookah time.  Lots of choices and my wife chose their \"pina colada\" which was fine and tasted as advertised.  3 bricks would have been enough for 4-6 people to smoke let alone two.\n\nCount on me as a repeat customer!  At the very least I'll order their great Middle Eastern food to go since they're open so late or we'll lounge out the next time my wife has \"the itch\".",

    "text": "Going from best to worst:\n\n5 stars:\n\nThe service was excellent.  Our Italian waiter named \"Loan\" was totally on point from start to finish.  The tableside Caesar salad (which originated from Mexico and has nothing to do with Italy) he made was a marvel.  He made the dressing from scratch right in front of us starting with the egg yolk, spices, anchovy and everything else after.  It was so cool to watch.  He certainly wasn't modest about his tableside Caesar skills either saying he \"made it the best\" and it delivered!  This is a must order and for $9 a person is a better deal than the other salads on the menu.  \n\n4 stars:\n\nI am a sucker for handmade pasta but we thought ordering a full entree plate of that would be insanely too much food so we begrudgingly went with the lobster black truffle baked ziti.  This was supposed to be a side dish but it was a huge portion easily for 4 people and it was so good!  They definitely didn't skimp on the lobster meat and it made for great leftovers the next day.  \n\nNutfish Z's great review twisted my arm into ordering the \"Andiamo Grande Meatball\".  Just what I need right?  A meat appetizer followed by an entree of more meat!  The meatball was a little smaller than the size of a softball and was a handmade blend of veal, pork and beef.   It was a little more on the solid side and the sauce with the ricotta cheese topping really was a great blend of flavor.  Nice meatball!  This is not to be mistaken for their side dish of meatballs which is only beef and pork.   \n\n3 stars:\n\nWe got a side order of the \"olive oil grilled asparagus with cipollini onions\" which was a nice sized portion compared to most other steakhouses.  The sauce on top was good and I like cipollini onions on pretty much anything including Fruity Pebbles.  \n\n2 stars:\n\nOur waiter gave us 2 surprise plates of spaghetti topped with a kind of tomato cream sauce courtesy of the chef right before our entrees came out.  It was totally unnecessary filler considering we already ordered a pasta dish and I didn't think it was very good.  I saw Ron S's photo afterward with his caption asking if the sauce came from a can.  I thought the same thing!  My wife liked it better than I did.  I know I sound like a putz complaining about free food but this wasn't needed at all and I would just set this aside if/when they give it to you before the entrees come out.  \n\n1 star:\n\nIt pains me to even write this but it was the goddamn steak itself!!  I got the bone in ribeye (had plans to go for the Tomahawk after Teri W's great review but they have since upped the price from $65 to $79) and my wife got the filet mignon. \n \nI take my first bite and shake my head kinda like \"huh\"?  I take another bite, get more perplexed and then I take a final bite from a different section, turn to my wife and say \"this is not good at all\".  The ribeye was lukewarm at best, dry and wasn't even up to par with the $13 flat iron steak I had at Herbs and Rye a few days before that.  \n\nMy wife's filet mignon was good....if you want it to taste like AHI TUNA!!!  She was surprisingly OK with it though so who was I to argue?  Loan comes back, asks how things are and I tell him my problems with the ribeye.  It was as if this quality of steak should have been saved for fools that ordered well done.  It also seemed like the steak had been sitting in the kitchen for a while based on the temperature.  Loan seemed stunned by this as was I.  I've had plenty of ribeyes and this was the first time I've ever sent one back.  I've only thought about doing it one other time (N9NE) but didn't pull the trigger.  I would've sent back my wife's filet had I ordered that as well.  \n\nI got the porterhouse instead which was MILES AND MILES better.  It was juicy and beefy where it was supposed to be and the temperature was to my satisfaction.  That was 3.5 stars.  \n\nSo in the end, I would still come back here for the Italian fare, Caesar salad, ambiance and service but you might want to stick with Vic and Anthony's a couple of casinos over if you're looking for great steak.",

    "text": "Eating at Nobu is like breaking out an old record collection and revisiting classic tunes.  Sure, I can get dishes like yellowtail jalapeno, rock shrimp and black cod with miso anywhere now.  But there's special, fuzzy place in my heart for Nobu...it's where I lost my \"upscale sushi\" virginity all those years ago in Tribeca.  Every meal in any location has always been awesome and never has let me down.  Just like vodka!\n\nThis particular location is very pretty and the big cocoon-like booths look really cool.  Why are they still at the Hard Rock?  Does Mr. Hard Rock have nude photos of Mr. Nobu eating at Panda Express or something??   They also have the most expansive menu that I've seen from Matsuhisa-san, so branching out from the oldies but tasties was a must. \n\nTheir version of hamachi kama was the best I've ever had.  Impressive in size, the heavy on the salt based seasoning and brick oven baked flavor was outstanding.  The yellowtail meat was so tender that it had everyone gnawing on the bones with bare hands just to get every bit.  The server almost lost a limb when he prematurely assumed we were done.  \n\nAfter very little convincing, so minimal in fact that I think I exclaimed \"YES! THAT!\" while pointing at the guy as soon as he said \"chu-toro\", we got the daily special of the medium fatty tuna topped with truffle, crispy garlic and greens.  They were indeed a divine couple of bites that had me wanting more.  I love tuna more than life.  Even my car license plate says \"tuna\" in Japanese.\n\nNobu still delivers after all these years!",

    "text": "Skinnyfats is a terrific mix of healthy and semi-unhealthy (happy) and really caters to almost everyone.  There are a ton of healthy options and that showed with the majority of the fitness clientele who were there during my late 2:30pm lunch.  I thought it would be pretty slow around this time but it was packed.\n\nI got the \"Cranburkey\" (special recipe turkey burger dressed with arugula, tomato, red onion and a cranberry basil yogurt spread on a 9 grain bun) which was very good.  The highlight was definitely the cranberry basil yogurt spread and this set it apart from the hundreds of turkey burgers I've eaten.  The patty had good flavor and I wouldn't hesitate to order this again.  \n\nI had a choice of truffle fries, sweet potato fries (no more parsnip) or a salad.  To keep it healthy, I should have gone with the salad but I am glad I didn't because they have the GREATEST sweet potato fries I have ever had.  I am sure they were made in house.  The little crystals of sugar on them really took it to another level.  No condiments were necessary with those.  I can't believe I took that many sentences to talk about sweet potato fries but they were really awesome!\n\nMy skinny wife that never gains any weight ordered from the \"happy side\" of the menu.  She ordered the \"Chix on Broadway\".  Is it a wonder this tasted better than the Cranburkey????  Maybe because it was fried chicken with bacon, cheddar, lemon mayo on a brioche roll but that's just a hunch.  The batter and the fry of the chicken was atypical.  The breading itself was thin so it wasn't your traditional fry but it was still very good.   \n\nI got a large \"Mr Green\" drink which was a mix of spinach, parsley, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, cucumber, cilantro, apple.  This was probably the first and last green drink I will have with cilantro.  I'll order this again without it as that was the most prevalent flavor next to apple juice.  I do love the majority of green drinks in the world though.  There were 2 options for complimentary water.  One was strawberry basil and the other was raspberry lemon and both were very refreshing.\n\nThe space is inviting and set up nicely.  The designer definitely maximized the area.  It just goes to show that if a business offers an excellent product, people will come from anywhere to have it even if they're located in an industrial park on Dean Martin next to a strip club.",

    "text": "The top two things to like here are the quality and price.  There is definitely some bang for your buck to be had.  Well known spots like McCormick and Schmick's would feature these entrees at much more than these guys charge.  They also offer a discount for LVAC members.  \n\nWe started with the \"New England Clam Chowder\" which was served in a bread bowl with plenty of oyster crackers for some elegant carb on carb action.  The soup was delicious and the clams were plentiful.  This was a steal for $4.50.\n\nI got the \"Seared Ahi Tuna\" plate which came with a side and cole slaw.  You can see from all the pictures that you get A LOT of tuna for $15.  The tuna was seasoned in Cajun spice and it was terrific.   I paid $1 extra to get another side and opted for the quinoa and kale salad.  The kale salad was great and the mix of strawberries, almonds, carrots, jicama, cranberries and more made me feel like a walking antioxidant afterwards.  I will most likely just order the tuna and kale salad combo next time which is a couple of bucks less but you get the same size tuna and more salad.  \n\nMy wife got the salmon with garlic butter sauce.  That sauce was so good that we asked for an extra side of it.  It had the consistency of tartar sauce and was a welcome change.  The salmon was grilled well although the pieces were not as big as the tuna.  \n\nIt's definitely a casual atmosphere since you're ordering from the cash register. I imagine they get a lot of take out orders for lunch.  This is another solid choice for lunch if you're leaning towards the healthy side of things....or not since the fried catfish in their pics looks amazing too.  The only thing I felt was missing from dinner was some wine.  Not sure if they plan on serving it in the future.",

    "text": "We got a coupon in the mail offering $25 in free match play and 25% off the food bill not including alcohol so we thought we'd give it a shot.  I was unaware that \"The Bar\" was actually a chain in town so I read up on the one by Grand Canyon Drive.  This new location is the closest bar to my house so we had high hopes it would be decent enough to become semi-regulars.  \n\nI had never been to this bar when it was previously Bootleg Benny's but the place was completely redone according a patron I talked to and it definitely shows.  The setup is right up there with an above average video poker bar with a few more choices for food than just wings and burgers.  \n\nHappy hour consisted of $2 Bud Light, Michelob Ultra and well drinks.  I was hoping for some food deals but no dice.  Thanks to Rich W's review of The Bar on Grand Canyon, I got the prime rib sandwich which totally delivered.  Nice juicy slices of prime rib topped with deep fried jalapeno slices and horseradish but the real kicker was how good the bun was.  My wife got the turkey avocado wrap but for some reason they forgot to put in the avocado so they sliced up half of one and brought it on a plate afterwards.  That was tasty as well since the turkey was roasted and cubed instead of just being your run of the mill deli meat.\n\nThe machines were also kind enough to bestow a couple of quads to us which took care of our bill.  The TV's were pretty good so I will definitely be back to watch a few games.",

    "text": "Forte was mysteriously closed on a recent Saturday night, yet my wife was unable to shake her hunger for Eastern European cuisine.  Nothing else would do.  You know those Snickers commercials \"you're not you when you're hungry\"?  My wife turned into Dolph Lundgren aka Ivan Drago from Rocky 4.  For a brief moment, I feared for my life ;)  A Bulgarian friend recommended BG Bistro a while ago and it was the perfect time to give it a shot. \n\nI found it curious that outdoor seating was offered when all to see was a Smith's supermarket parking lot.  The cigarette smoke hit me as soon as I entered.  Was this their way of staying authentically Eastern Europe?  I kinda felt like a tourist.  With all the college football games going on that moment, they opted to show golf and soccer on their TV's to enhance the Europeanness.  I could see the smoke being a huge turnoff to prospective patrons, definitely wore it upon exit.   But on this evening, we would NOT be deterred.   DRAGO!!!\n\nOur friendly waitress walked us through the menu and specials.  The priciest entr\u00e9es were the daily specials of lamb chops or grilled trout for only $13.  I was so close to getting one of them, but the kufteta was calling my name.  Grilled Bulgarian meatballish burger patties made with pork were juicy and accompanied by 3 small salads: potato, bean (blaaand), and cabbage.  The tomato sauce on the side went well with the kufteta, we asked for more.    \n\nI should have traded out the bean salad for fries topped with Bulgarian feta.  Lots of tables ordered that as a stand-alone dish.   Bulgarian feta is good stuff.  It's quite different from the popular Greek version, creamy while still being firm.  That really shines when shredded like in the shopska salad at the start of our meal.  It also tasted great when baked in a clay pot with lukanka, egg and tomato sauce.  The lukanka had a nice, lean salami and bacon taste to it.  I'd love to try their other dried meats.  The Bulgarian red wine was served cold and went well with everything.  A bottle was only $18.  Nazdrave!  \n   \nGot talked into the biscuit cake for dessert after some arm-twisting.....light twistin..............OK....no freaking twist at all.  She simply suggested it and we said yes.   Glad we did!  It was like a sweeter tiramisu.  \n\nSo the food definitely made up for the smokiness, but BG Bistro would not be for everyone.   Pretty cool that it's in the same plaza as Villa Algarve though.  A burgeoning international plaza!!  \n\n3.78548287486539693103 stars",

Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.  \n\nMy jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!\n\nThe spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.     \n\nThen all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were \"tender as fuck\".  I agreed.  \n\nThe main event was the \"Four Pasta Special\" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.\n\nMy wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.  If a full on Italian pig out is what you're looking for, look no further.",

They can't compete with the big boys down the street.  \n\nMy wife got the tonkotsu ramen and while the broth was decent, they gave her thin noodles which she didn't like at all.  The server didn't even offer a choice and the thick noodles in my deluxe were way better.  The deluxe definitely wasn't skimpy on ingredients but the broth was bland and the charsiu was just OK.  I would have ordered the deluxe with tonkotsu ramen or shoyu (soy sauce) if I could do it again.  \n\nWhat's up with no music in the restaurant?  I felt like I was eating ramen in a library.\n\nIs 3 stars the new 2 stars?  Even the 3 star reviews are telling readers to go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Seems like pubs done by celebrity chefs are all the rage now.  I think it was a smart idea by Rick Moonen to change the upstairs of RM Seafood to this.  It's a really cool space with interesting furniture and displays.  I have no idea what steampunk is though.  I can only imagine Joey Ramone in a sauna.  \n\nWe chose to sit at the bar to chat it up with the bartenders and get their opinions on drinks etc.  It was also a treat to see them make some of these concoctions.  I know quite a few Yelpers that love the whiskey and this should be a spot to check out.  I will definitely try the smoked whiskey next time.  Check out some of the other people's pics.  \n\nMy wife wasn't into any of the specialty cocktails and opted for the appletini (ha fn ha).  But they used actual apple instead of that Pucker BS so it tasted as legit as an appletini could.  I went with some long titled cocktail called \"Mario Warped the something something\" which featured egg white, tequila and thyme.  It tasted like a margarita made by a mad scientist.  I also had a bottle of an Austrian lemon beer I'd never had before which was super refreshing.  \n\nThe chicken liver pate was just OK.  One of the bartenders tried to build up the fact that the pate was \"like in this totally cool jar\".  That'd be interesting if Thomas Keller hadn't already been doing that up the street at Bouchon since they opened.  I prefer duck liver pate any day of the week.  I'd skip this.  \n\nInteresting idea with the inside out French onion grilled cheese but I feel like it totally missed the mark on both ends.  I'd rather have an excellent grilled cheese sandwich or a robust and cheesy French onion soup than this combo.  This is a skip too.\n\nWe both really liked the Lamb Osso Bucco Greek style.  Two gloriously tender shanks of lamb with orzo on the bottom that was swimming in the lamb juice.  Anthony M's picture of it is way better than mine.\n\nShockingly the best thing we had was dessert.  2 of the bartenders kept raving and raving about the green tea panna cotta with pineapple and macadamia nut cookie. It was definitely all that.     \n\nI am rounding up on Rx Boiler Room.  It was more like 3.683712 stars but I think some of the dishes we passed on this first go around will be things I look forward to trying soon.  \n\nHey Rick!  How about a happy hour??",

    "text": "\"Sex is kinda like pizza. When it's bad, it's still pretty good\" \n\n- Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) from the movie \"Threesome\"\n\nI originally came for the 50 cent beer happy hour they have from 5-5:50pm and ended up with dinner.  The bar was packed when we rolled in at 5:20 but fortunately a couple of guys were leaving. \n\nMy wife and I probably wouldn't have come here had it not been for this phenomenal deal on brew.  The reviews have been mixed at best and since there are now some pretty legit spots for pizza in LV, I wasn't exactly rushing to try any of this at strip prices.  \n\nThe only thing that was pretty consistent with all the reviews was how good the crust was.  If that's the star of the whole damn pie, I figured I would just be screwing it up by adding things like truffle, clams, rosemary or broccoli rabe.  We went with their margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella and basil) with extra cheese.  I definitely wasn't getting good value since all the other pizzas with toppings were only $1-$5 more but we did have 8 beers for 50 cents each so that justified my whole deal.  \n\nThe sauce was sweeter than usual which surprised me upon first bite but it worked.  Cheese was cheese and basil was basil and that was all just a vehicle for the crust.  The crust was really good.  I like it a little well done and there was a good balance of chewy and crunchy.\n\nSee you sometime between 5 and 5:50!",

    "text": "My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said \"yes\" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.\n\nNext thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all \"eff it, we're starving, let's eat\".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  \n\nWe chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:\n\nChef: Did you just get married?\nUs: No.  It's been over 6 years.\nChef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.\n\n(a few minutes later)\n\nChef asks my wife: Is it your birthday?\nWife: No it's not.\nChef: Well why else would he take you here?\n\nHAHA\n\n(later)\n\nChef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.\nMe: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!\n\nSo on to the food.  They had an appetizer called \"The Shit\".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  \n\nTheir pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?\n\nI liked their sashimi plates, fresh oysters and our comedic chef sliced up some special pieces that weren't escolar or had cream cheese in them.  Nice.

    "text": "I am rounding up on this place a tad.  There were a lot of dishes that sounded great but we didn't order them since it was just my wife and I.  Speaking of the 2 of us, we were also the only ones in the entire restaurant from 5:30-7:00pm.  Thanks to Mike C. for his review because I wouldn't have known of this place and apparently no one else does either.  \n\nIt's a pretty big place, the furniture and atmosphere are nice.  I think this used to be a teppenyaki place based on how they've creatively redesigned the designated area where past chefs flung egg shells into their hats.  They also have a little bar area.  We chose to sit in the smaller room off to the side since they had a TV showing baseball.  The music was mainly K-pop with Britney and Taylor Swift thrown into the mix.  \n\nThe menu is separated into \"traditional\" and \"modern\" sections.  Some modern dishes that popped out for me were the seared beef belly salad and caramelized sea scallop that I'll save for a future trip.  We ended up going with one of their sets called \"Amber\".  There are 4 sets to choose from and they consist of 2 dishes and 2 beers that accompany those plates well.  So \"Amber\" came with 2 bottles of Sam Adams plus the \"Crispy Bulgogi\" and \"Tofu Kimchi\".  We also got an order of the fried chicken because the photos of it looked so damn good and that was the first thing our server recommended.  \n\nTheir \"Tofu Kimchi\" was pretty spicy and my favorite dish.  The menu description was unfair since it only said \"soft tofu, kimchi, pork\" so I was just expecting a bowl of everything mixed but the thin individually sliced pieces of tofu then topped with a good portion of pork and spiced up kimchi made for a tasty surprise.  I initially thought that was going to be the most boring dish we ordered but that turned out to be the \"Crispy Bulgogi\" which wasn't really even that crispy and pretty dry.  The fried chicken was awesome.  The pieces were all dark meat, perfectly fried with crisp outsides and juicy insides.  The dressing that it came with was really good too.  \n\n9 on the Plate would probably be a raging success if it were located on Spring Mountain but it might be a tall order in this shopping plaza even though Sen of Japan is also there.  I wish them luck!",

    "text": "3.5 stars\n\nIf someone opens up a tonkatsu restaurant in Japan, the owner is convinced that their tonkatsu is fucking awesome and the best around.  While there's certainly no market for upscale $30+ tonkatsu meals on the corner of Jones and Robindale, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi does a decent job of breading, frying and serving meat.  They're definitely the best around...since they're the only place around!!\n\nMy wife got the hire (pork) katsu dinner which was better than the ebi (shrimp) katsu.  The shrimp was quite large which was a plus.  I went with the ebi just to have a variety but I should have just gotten the other pork option (Rosu).  After all, there's a pig on the freakin sign so that should give you some hints on what to order.  The meal comes with miso soup, rice and a little onion.  \n\nAfter you grind the sesame seeds, transfer the amount you'd like into the black dish with the sauce, don't put the sauce directly into the grinding bowl.  That's the wrong way to do it and you limit the size of the piece you dip by using the small bowl.  I noticed several people doing this while we were there.    \n\nThe quality of their pork is better than Japanese Curry Zen and they give a substantial amount more.  I plan on trying the katsu curry next time for sure and I'll be ready to bump it up a star or two if the curry is great.",

    "text": "This is the BEST steakhouse off the strip.  And even with that, Echo & Rig has SO much more going for it!\n\nI came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy Saturday night.  Even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager I spoke with on the phone the day before (Cheryl) was very helpful as I had my eye on the big long striped wooden table that was pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  We arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  Yum freakin yum.\n\nWith so many small plates offered, Echo & Rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  We split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  The kale salad with yellow beets, toasted hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  Their \"over the rainbow salad\" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & Champagne vinaigrette.  That's a vegetarian's dream right there.  And the fried spinach salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  The crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de Arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do that justice.  It was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  I was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  All of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  \n\nI got the \"Spencer Steak\" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  Each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and I went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  My medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better that way.  It was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  My wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.\n\nThen there's the freakin value of it all!!  The priciest entree is only $35!  NO corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), NO cake fee (got a cake from Patisserie Manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  The total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at Carnevino.  Total Wine and More is just across the way in Boca Park so pick something up there.  \n\nI cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes I must try like bone marrow carne asada and Hawaiian cowboy.  I also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  They also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the Tivoli Village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   \n\nThe staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  They earned their tips and then some! I'm ready to go back for lunch.  \n\nSay hi to the pig heads outside!!",

Dinner for 4 came out to around $60 before tip and we got to try a nice variety of dishes.\n\nIt was easy to see and taste the high grade fish they used right off the bat in the \"Seared Tuna Special\" which included crispy shallots, sweet onion, micro greens and chili oil combined with super fresh nigiri cuts of maguro.  This was a terrific mix of flavors.  $11!  That's about 50% off the strip price.  I almost wished I didn't have to share it.  \n\nI couldn't turn my back on the $3 (!!) Soho Tostadas and went with the tuna with Hawaiian poke sauce.  The tostada itself was made of taro and there were some delicious chunks of tuna on top mixed with cilantro and avocado cream.  Another great starter for sure.  The rock shrimp done tempura style was also nice portion for $7 and came with 3 unique sauces that I fail to remember the details of since my wife was seriously sweating the end of the Seahawks/Rams Monday night game due to some sports bets she had.  It was nice they had one TV up.\n\nHydro Bibb Black Cod for $5 was a total freakin tease that ensured I'll get a full order of miso marinated black cod the next time.  Even the smaller portioned cod were cooked really well and the combo of cool lettuce, crispy wontons and fish was kind of like a deluxe protein taco.  \n\nThose all were excellent opening acts for what I was personally here for which was the short rib dish.  Ever since I saw that one picture of all those short ribs being grilled, I knew it was destiny!  It totally delivered.  The one rib was like something out of the The Flintstones and tasted as good as it looked.  It was juicy and so tender that you could've just picked at it with chopsticks sans fork and knife.  \n\nThe chef and owner of Soho, John Chien Lee, stopped by our table to ask how things were and gave us a breakdown on the business.  We were still open to one more dish so I asked him for a recommendation.  He asked what we liked and we said salmon.  He asked if we wanted something cooked or raw and we said raw.  He said he'd make something special for us off the menu (YES!) and 10 minutes later brought over this delectable dish with 8 pieces of scallop wrapped with salmon topped with a little green, lemon and some other stuff I can't remember.  John whipped up this dish thinking it would be a great finish to the meal after the heaviness of the short rib and MAN was he right.  Then he told us it was on the house!  Thanks, John!!  I suck for not taking photos of anything.  \n\nLas Vegas strip quality for locals!  Check it out.",

    "text": "They've been sending out coupons in the mail for a couple of weeks now so I got a takeout order.  The deal was BOGO meat platter with the purchase of 2 large drinks.  \n\nThe place was pretty dead on a Wednesday night as I only saw 2 customers dining at 7pm.  I got a rib plate and a 3 meat combo.  Both came with 2 sides each, a roll and pickles and onions.\n\nMy 3 meats were pulled pork, beef brisket and turkey.  All of them were good with the brisket being best.  There have been a lot of complaints about the brisket in several reviews being cold or dry.  The lady in front of me ordered a pound of brisket but let it be known she worked for a well known publication in town and spoke with the manager on duty as well.  I think they brought out the most recently cooked brisket because of this.  Maybe everyone should do this to ensure the best quality meat?\n\nThe ribs sucked big time.  I am not sure if it was the quality of the meat, the preparation or all of the above but they were very disappointing.  I won't be ordering these again.  They advertise them as \"fall off the bone\" and it was anything but that.  Stay on the bone ribs?  \n\nI also saw that Nadine K just posted a picture of her ribs from this location and mine did NOT look like that at all.  Her ribs look much better.  Maybe she works for Time magazine?  I would also avoid the green beans with bacon side since that was a watery mess with not so fresh beans.  \n\nI know I'll be back from time to time as long as they keep sending coupons but it's only because it's quick and near my home.",

    "text": "I had been eagerly awaiting the opening of Settebello in Summerlin for some time now and jumped at the chance to go last Wednesday.  I thought their Henderson location was the best pizza I'd had in LV so that's what I expected.  It wasn't the same but it was still pretty good.\n\nLet's start off with the restaurant itself.  The place is big compared to the original and they did an awesome job with the decor, open kitchen and cool bar area.  I look forward to coming back for happy hour multiple times.  $5 mini pizzas among other food deals from 3pm-6pm ensures that.  \n\nSo my wife and I split the \"Panzanella\" salad (House Made Croutons, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto Crisps, Red Onion, Fennel, Cucumber, Basil, Arugula, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Wine Vinaigrette) which was good as usual.  I really like the prosciutto crisps since they're basically super bacon bits and could've used more of them but no biggie.   \n\nThen the pizzas came out.  My wife got the Margherita DOC which was topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella as opposed to the regular cheese and well worth the $1-$2 upgrade.  I usually get the Settebello pizza (Crushed Tomatoes, Pancetta, Wood Oven Sausage, Roasted Mushrooms, Toasted Pine Nuts, Mozzarella, Basil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil) but chose to get the Pizza Carbonara instead.  I should've stuck with the Settebello.  Why mess with perfection?  Pancetta, egg, mozzarella and crushed tomatoes just sounded so good but it didn't come together as well as I was hoping.\n\nFunnily enough, when the waiter came to ask how everything was and we gave our obligatory \"fine\", he just comes out of nowhere and says \"Yeah.  I am kinda conflicted on the carbonara....\" and just walks away.  Hmmmmm.  Not enough pancetta or sauce and the crust wasn't as well done as I wanted it to be.  But after all, it was still pizza and it was good but not the best.  My wife's margherita was great.  \n\nI still have a lot of love for Settebello and look forward to bumping it up to 5 stars.",

    "text": "If an AYCE sushi buffet simply offered fresh fish and all the usual suspects for rolls, it would have automatically been 3-4 stars a few years ago.  But fortunately for people in LV, this isn't the case anymore since so many spots have stepped up their game post-Goyemon.  \n\nWhile the service and atmosphere are good, hot rice, some weird interpretations of what they think is \"Japanese\" and fusion missteps will be the biggest reasons I won't be a returning customer. \n\nGetting into details... \n\n- I know not to expect authentic cold, well seasoned sushi rice at AYCE but straight out of the cooker is bad.\n  \n- What they have on the menu as \"okonomiyaki\" is NOT that.  I've eaten hundreds of okonomiyaki and this was by far the whackest one of all.  Ketchup on top?  The consistency of a crepe?  Everyone sells a roll called \"something wrong\".  Maybe they should call this the \"something wrong pancake\".  \n\n- They put a deep fried shrimp head into the miso soup.  Try having that fly well with a native Japanese (my wife).\n\n- Amaebi was terrible.  They drenched the thing in sauce and then put tobiko on top.  I assume this was just their way of covering up something else.  \n\n- Steamed pork belly was weird.  Koreans eat it this way?  That's like steaming high end bacon.\n\nAnd finally, they had a sushi roll with peanut butter on it.  Not a typo.  My mind's telling me nooooo..but my BODY.  While I respect them for trying to push the fusion envelope, this was terrible.  Peanut butter, avocado, shrimp tempura with crab and fried coconut on top tastes like you would imagine it would.  I don't understand why they thought this would be good.  If they wanted to be extreme, make the whole roll that way.  Pork belly or beef would have been better choices to combine with PB than shrimp and then just put Cheetos all over the mofo.  \n\nTetsuro P. saw that I had checked in here and stopped in to say hello which was cool.  He asked if what they were doing was authentic and I just said \"no\" without going into any detail since we were right in front of the sushi chef.  \n\nNot to say it was a complete loss, there were some good parts.  Their \"bomb\" which was wrapped in avocado was decent.  The waitress mainly recommended Korean dishes like bulgogi and their skewers which we skipped since we had plans to eat Korean the next day.  I also enjoyed their yellowtail jalapeno.  But it won't be enough for me to come here again.  I would go to Umiya (both Korean owned) over this any day of the week.",

    "text": "Lord knows how many businesses have come and gone at this address over the years like Underworld, Black Label, and Emergency Room etc.  Its transformation into Gyu-Kaku has been nothing short of amazing.  The ultra cool lit entrance begged the question...does Tron eat here?  Being seated while a female sung cover of Savage Garden's \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\" at 300 BPM's blared through the stereo made me think it possible if he were drunk.  \n\nWe considered the course dinners priced at $55, $66 and $77 for a moment but saw a lot of filler that would have ended up untouched like cheese wontons, chicken cheese fondue, house salad, fried chicken (ok,ok, maybe one piece), calamari and S'mores.  Our initial server, Keiko, recommended we start with the spicy cabbage salad over the kim-chee.  Thankfully, we listened.  Crispy, spicy and dare I say refreshing?  It was a fine way to whet our appetite.        \n \nStanding out among with meats was the beef tongue and harami skirt steak.  Quality matched the price and both delivered on what decent yakiniku should be.  We also enjoyed the kalbi short rib and although the Angus beef ribs were a little too fatty for the wife, I happily devoured it.  The mushroom medley cooked in an unbeatable combination of soy sauce and butter was a nice side dish.  \n\nThe only letdown was the \"Spicy Kalbi Bibimbap\".  They got the stone pot right but the rest of it?  It was as if it were made by a northern Swedish resident with no knowledge of Korean cuisine attempting to replicate it through hearsay.  I would have rather ordered the sliced duck breast, an atypical yakiniku offering, or dessert over this pointless filler.  \n\nDespite that, I know I'll be back and stick to grilling.  It's yet another welcome dining choice around Spring Mountain.  3.46729311238987 stars.",

    "text": "I had this crazy fantasy that Mario Batali himself was in the back grinding up Carnevino's riserva, ribeye and porterhouse cuts to be made into patties.  Not exactly the case but the guys behind one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas definitely know beef.  So a visit here was inevitable despite the mixed reviews.\n\nBefore B&B burger opened, Batali himself said \"The food will be easier to accept if you've never heard of me.\"  Everyone comes to expect so much with his name on the front.  \n\nMy verdict: a damn good burger!  We ordered what most reviewers got and also what the servers recommended.  The \"Morning After\" was everything I want in a good burger.  The patty was a very juicy medium rare.  The egg on top looked and tasted so perfect upon my first bite which then turned into a beautiful mess of yolk everywhere.  The bun itself was excellent with a kind of croissant quality to it.  I was only able to notice it after eating part of the bun separately though.  The royale with cheese was also very good and my wife preferred this more with all its caramelized onion glory.\n\nI still would have paid more for a riserva patty though :)",

    "text": "There's nothing else like this in Las Vegas and you should go now because who knows if they'll be able to sustain the air of coolness (hope!) it has once everyone knows.  If you combined the whole craft cocktail scene that's emerged in the last few years, off kilter shows like \"Absinthe\", the lurking human oddity stuff that's popped up at some club spots and the fucking jadedness to the $3k bottle service/fist pump crowd, Rose.Rabbit.Lie is like a culmination of all of this and seems so right for right now.  It's really refreshing!  There was also this whole underlying \"Eyes Wide Shut\" feel to the whole thing in a good way.   \n\nThanks to Edwin P, my wife and I were able see the 8pm show of \"Vegas Nocturne\".  I won't go into any details of the show but I thought it was terrific.  This is what I imagine vaudeville shows were like but with some added modern nuances.  If you liked Absinthe, you will like this.    \n\nWe hung out for a while in their \"music room\" which was fantastic.  I am not sure what genre to technically call the band but it was like an old school New Orleans band with horns playing modern hits.  One of the funniest performers in \"Vegas Nocturne\" belted out a psycho version of \"Blurred Lines\" that had everyone on their feet.  There were some really unique performers after her too.  \n\nI had a chance to look at the dinner menu which looked great.  We definitely plan on doing that soon.  Caviar tacos, foie gras, steak and some really interesting dishes I fail to remember due to the cocktails.  Can't wait to go back!",

If you've never had an empanada, think of it as the biggest and best gourmet hot pocket ever...and maybe think about trying some new restaurants :)\n\nChoices, choices, choices!!  So many fillings to try.  My wife got the Veggie Chicken Tikka Masala.  Their faux meat of choice is a British brand called Quorn.  It's not as firm as Gardein but blended really well with the curried sauce, potatoes, peppers and had great texture.  I got the Veggie Cottage Pie (Quorn vegetarian ground beef, peas, carrots, grilled onions, mashed potatoes and cheddar. With a side of HP sauce.) that really hit the spot as it was savory and just got better bite after bite.  We also got to see the guys make a set of pasties by the bar and it looked as homemade as you could get.  \n\nI'd say this would be an ideal place for lunch but you'd be seriously missing out on one major thing...their beer list!!  That is unless you can get away with being buzzed and having beer breath at work.  If that's the case, please PM me your work address so I can apply.  There are a ton of great beers from Joseph James to Chimay to a lot of British brands I have never heard of.  I got a beer that tasted like banana bread.  The bartender told me he didn't like it, my wife hated it, I loved it!!!\n\nThen there's the whole atmosphere...really cool!  No video poker at the bar.  No TV anywhere!  The Cure and Sex Pistols blaring from the speakers.  Very refreshing!  \n\nCheck out the menu: http://www.cornishpastyco.com/menu/",

    "text": "EDIT 12/2/2014: Chef Hong no longer works there.  Booooooo\n\nI will definitely be a regular now that Chef Hong (ex-Moko) is bringing out his inventive dishes at Kanji.  The former Geisha House location comes off like an Epcot Center restaurant for Japanese food.  The multiple teppanyaki stations, large sushi bar, block wood furniture, full bar, high ceilings and bright lights are very welcoming.  The complimentary sake bomb (one of the best Yelp check-in offers currently) only enhance that feeling.  \n\nLike an amazing movie sequel (very rare), all of Hong's beloved edible characters are here: beef short ribs, 30 hour pork belly, shrimp risotto, in-house smoked fish etc.  They're now being presented with some new and interesting twists from his original, wizardly recipes.  What stay consistent are the flavors, quality and creativity.  There are also some new plates like the excellent miso glazed Chilean seabass and 7 hour pork shoulder.  Seriously.....find me a local sushi joint that's pushing out entrees like these and I will wear a Britney Spears shirt for a week.  \n\nThey don't offer AYCE sushi, but the nigiri I've tried has been of excellent quality.  We were informed that they receive fresh shipments every two days which is pretty remarkable.  Kanji also offers a killer late night happy hour from 10pm-2am Monday through Saturday that I plan on checking out pretty soon.",

    "text": "Consider me a big fan!  \n\nI was perusing potential spots for dinner last night and then I saw My T's picture of the 5 spice game hen and it..waS...ON.  They bake the game hen and THEN deep fry it!  Why don't more spots bake and then fry things?  It tasted even better than it looked.  The side of tomato rice was really good too.  I almost never rave about eating bird but I will be having this again.   \n\nAnother favorite was their shaken beef salad.  I was shaken up after my first freakin bite!  The beef was so juicy and so tender and only $12!  The hot grilled beef mixed with the cool lettuce, onion, tomato and spices made for one of the best salads I've had in recent memory. \n\nThe Mekong River noodle soup was just ok.  It looked great and was filled with lots of fixings like fish balls, pork tenderloin, quail eggs, veggies and shrimp but the pork based broth fell short for me.  I saw a lot of customers going for the bone marrow soup and holy shit what a spectacle that was.  HUGE bones!  Me would feel like caveman and raise bone like champion (grunt!).  Check out the pics of it.  \n\nBut man oh man so much other stuff I want to try like the slow braised pork belly entree, crispy bird nest noodle and more shaken beef!  They're located in the old Cravin Cajun spot so it's great for groups.  I hope they get their liquor license soon.",

    "text": "I gave away our card with 4 stamps at the end of the meal.  THAT'S how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  \n\nThis isn't sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rolls/inventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like this:\n\n\"Tastes and smells like your bitchy ex-mother in law's 1st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll:  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side.\"\n\nAs you can see, they used the whole \"I Love Sushi\" concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner (as many Yelp reviews can attest) trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasn't fun, but it sure was funny.  \n\n- Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I don't know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.\n  \n-Speaking of sauce...what's up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  \n\n-Pretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. \n\n-1 order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So that's where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!\n\n- I didn't know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didn't even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.\n\n- My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!\n\nAt least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life.",

    "text": "I went on one of the nights they offered free bowling for 90 minutes plus half off food for locals.  Couldn't get over the size of the place!  Vegas has come a long way from the Gold Coast bowling alley.  At least GC still has all those great photos of people in bowling poses for scoring 300.  \n\nGood luck throwing a 300 here!  If anyone manages to do it with all the flashing lights and pizza grease on your thumb enhancing the spin of the ball ever so slightly, you might test positive for some substances.  I'd also like to meet you. \n\nBut bowling good isn't what it's all about at Brooklyn Bowl.  I feel that's true but I might still be like 2% sore over losing to a girl.  Not even barely.....dominated.  The atmosphere is really cool, good beers on tap starting at $8, and the balcony could be sneaky chill when it gets warmer.  A lot of fun will be had at this venue.      \n\nI wasn't digging the seats for bowling.  It would have been awkward if our party of 4 all sat on the big leather couch together as it was a tight squeeze.  The party of 8 across our table were pretty bunched up.  It also would've been kind of a mess had they ordered drinks and food too since all 12 of us were sharing one (albeit long) table.  \n\nDefinitely dine before bowling because eating with your hands, playing with balls and then eating more is gross.  Someone is bound for pink eye or worse.  Although \"The Fatty\" pizza was Stouffer's French bread pizza on steroids delicious, I had to eat it with a fork while standing.  That's kinda lame.  \n\nIt's all minor stuff in the whole picture of things.  Can't wait to check out some shows!  Lots of great acts on the schedule already.",

    "text": "Izakaya Cocokala's menu reflects a lot of what would be found at a typical street corner izakaya in Japan with a couple of wrinkles from the norm.  I was excited to check it out.  Things were looking even better when I was the only non-Japanese patron in a restaurant 75% full on a Sunday night.  That's always a good sign!  \n\nShocking me right off the bat was being served cold edamame.  Although typical in other places (like umm..Japan?), I've actually met people who grew up in Vegas thinking edamame was always served hot.  Even I expect it to be hot everytime in LV now for chrissakes.  I could tell this place gave a damn about \"keeping it real\" just from these itty bitty green things.\n\nMy wife was ready to order \"bakudan\" as soon as we sat down.  She thinks natto (fermented soybeans that smell like the foot of a corpse and taste even worse) is the single greatest culinary contribution from Japan to the world.  Cocokala's version included said item, tuna, okra, yamaimo (mountain potato) and spicy mustard.  Mix everything up and go to town because you're a braver person than I.  She thought this was awesome.  \n\nI didn't expect the grilled saba (mackerel) to be my favorite dish but it totally was.  Nice portioned filet with a terrific char, tender meat and the oil from the fish had me considering another order as soon as I finished.  This went very well with their samurai barley beer which was their strongest brew at 10% alcohol.  \n\nI also had a bottle of their stout brewed with oysters which tasted like you'd expect.....super funky Guinness.  My wife loved their Echigo red ale.  All the premium brews are $9-$10 for a 12 oz bottle.  They also have a nice selection of sake and shochu.      \n\nTheir chawanmushi (egg custard) was chockful of seafood deliciousness that rivaled Kyara's version.  I also thought highly of their take on black cod miso.  It's everything you'd expect at a very reasonable price.  \n\nChicken cartilage skewers were something I missed dearly from my days in Japan.  Usually the cartilage is stripped naked of any meat before it's grilled but I kind of liked it better their way with chicken meat still on it.  Cocokala would become my new best friend if they started serving fried chicken cartilage :)\n\nSome stuff didn't make this visit five stars but they're all things that are correctable and are probably due to being so new.  I thought the white meat yakitori were very dry.  The ume jiso (sour plum sauce) kind of masked the dryness a little but the wasabi yakitori wasn't good.  They mistakenly added a grilled hamachi to our receipt.  And instead of being offered a refill of water, the glasses were simply taken away.  \n\nNone of these are very big issues.  I am just happy there's another quality izakaya in town!!",

    "text": "I probably wouldn't turn down an invitation to return if a group wanted to go, the food was still decent after all.  But I would give the effort to talk everyone into a different venue all factors considered.  When determining my overall rating, I asked myself if I would choose this over Ruth's Chris up the street at Harrah's, and the answer was \"no\".   \n\nWe were seated at a table with a distant view of the big specials board to the rear of the main dining room.  On my left were a bunch of douches in tank tops and shorts, while on the far right was a very casual date where the guy was sporting flip flops...with socks on!  The group of four straight ahead placed a Fat Tuesday's yard drink on the table as if it were a wedding reception centerpiece.  Classy!  I regretted not wearing my best pizza sauce stained wifebeater and fluorescent green breakaway track pants.  \n\nIf brought to the table blindfolded, I wouldn't have argued had I been told this was Grand Lux Cafe.  It was only by the time our lobster cobb salad was served that I noticed the left section of the restaurant, which seemed much more secluded and dimly lit.  If I am to spend as I would at any other steakhouse on the strip, the joint should play the part.  I wouldn't celebrate an anniversary here.  \n\nOne may think twice about ordering that starchy side dish after they bring out the complimentary carbs.   BLT's signature popover was a delicious detour from the traditional roll and butter.   The exterior featured a delightful burnt cheese top which I went for first before getting into the soft, doughy, croissant-like center.  I want to dive into a huge ball pit full of these and eat my way out.  \n  \nAs expected, the rare porterhouse was the best part of dinner.   It was very thick, sufficiently juicy, and the herb butter enhanced the overall flavor nicely.  The outer charred crust complimented the cool bloody center of each piece and made for an enjoyable chew.  It bordered on a \"Pittsburgh style\" steak which I quite like when done right.  3.75 stars for the meat.\n\nBoth sides of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes lacked in temperature and were sent back upon first taste.  Our super friendly server, Leslie, was very apologetic.  The manager, Tammy, took my wife's glass of wine off the bill as compensation which was cool of them.  It was unfortunate that the re-cooked sides didn't arrive until we were pretty close to wrapping up the meal. \n\nOne and most likely done.  I like when eating a steak on the strip feels victorious.  So much so that I want to march out with the t-bone held up high like it were the Olympic torch and Chariots of Fire music is playing.  I didn't feel anywhere close to that here.",

    "text": "I can safely say this was my first time even remotely being excited to eat Italian food on the strip.  Currently the hottest restaurant in the city, Giada is bringing in the masses nightly.  I thought 90 days ahead of my 7th wedding anniversary would be adequate lead time for a 7pm-ish dinner on a Tuesday, but we ended up with 9pm.  Not a big deal.  That meant more drinks at the bar!  I had a few tasty \"Flash Gordon\" cocktails that made me feel semi-invincible; the sensation was unfortunately fleeting as I felt like Ming the Merciless had pointed his stupid ring to my head in the AM.  \n\nIf you do one thing above anything else with your time at Giada, my advice would be to wait for a premium table.  The hostess initially walked us to a less than favorable area with only a partial strip view.  Despite her warning that it could take half an hour or more for a better spot, we stayed strong and went back to the bar.  Luckily, she came back in less than 15 minutes and brought us to an excellent table with grand views of Bellagio and Caesars Palace.  \n\nLike Rod U. said in his excellent review, antipasti are where it's at.  If I could do it all over again, I would order more small plates of seafood, salumi, cheese, crostini, salumi, cheese, seafood and cheese.  The burrata was magnificent.  It was a creamy, mozzarella dream that tasted more heavenly as I got to the center.  Accompanying this glorious gift from cows with anything else more than olive oil, garnish and balsamic salt would have been offensive.  \n\nI had some serious doubts about the waiter's recommendation of the \"Prosciutto San Daniele\" since we recently had Carnevino's \"Prosciutto di Parma Riserva\", but that all went away when the first slice melted in my mouth.  As unimaginable to me as it could be, it was better than Batali's.  The waiter had tried Mario's as well and agreed. Not that he was biased or anything.....\n\nAnother highlight was Giada's signature spaghetti with 2 large shrimp, lemon and basil.  She really loves her citrus as it's all over the menu.  It was wonderful!  The handmade pasta was superb and the light cream sauce at the bottom of the bowl was well worth sopping up with the shrimp.  I am a huge sucker for fresh pasta.\n\nAlthough the \"Veal Chop Saltimbocca\" was an impressive looking entr\u00e9e in size, I felt it was underwhelming and quite plain.  This wasn't the kind of place that had salt and pepper shakers at the table, but I would have reached for some.  The massive leftover we brought home will definitely be getting some seasonal treatment.  The sauce it came with took it nowhere.  I wished we had given the branzino a shot instead.  At least the asparagus it came with was outstanding.  The wood grill brought out a whole new dimension of flavor to the standard upscale restaurant vegetable.  \n\nThe dessert cart they rolled out made final decisions tough but the strawberry tart, blackberry lime tiramisu and white coffee gelato (I'd bath in it) were great conclusions to an overall solid meal.  With dinner clocking in at almost 3 hours, Giada isn't a dinner before a show kind of place, this is the show.",

    "text": "Note to self: don't eat here alone.  \n\nWhat I thought would be a leisurely solo lunch turned into an unintentional pig out.  The plan was to simply have the juicy beef soup dumplings and then be on my merry way.  But when I opened the menu, it was as if I was wearing 3D glasses because letters and pictures were popping off the page and smacking me in the face.   Venison?  Fried lamb? Braised whole fish?  How soon can friends meet me so I can try more stuff?? \n\nI tried to stay calm and relaxed as the nice lady came over to take my order.  My thinking was that I would come back another time with a group to try more, but then I opened my stupid fucking mouth.  \"Soup dumplings, steamed lamb dumplings and vegetable noodles, please.\"\n \nIt was embarrassing when it all came out.  At that moment, I wished they offered study cubicle seating so people couldn't see what was in front of me.  Couldn't I just be a pig in private?  Why am I spending more than $30 on lunch today?  Customers just entering must have thought I was being rude by eating before my friends came back from the restroom.  No friends.  No sharing.  All mine.  \n\nI even thought there would be a chance of a group outside that would strip me of my clothes upon exit and march me down Spring Mountain repeatedly saying \"Shame. Shame.\" as a little bell rang and angry people threw shit at me.  It was official! Dumpling King made me go insane.    \n\nThis order would also be an effective remedy for people suffering from insomnia.  I was fast asleep in an hour!!",

    "text": "El Dorado Cantina is one of my favorite new restaurants in town.  This definitely rivals Javier's at Aria for the \"high end\" Vegas Mexican cuisine market, but the prices are way more reasonable.  Chef Paco and his staff are churning out some really good stuff.  \n\nWant a great way to spice up a weekday dinner?  How about doing as the Aztecs did back in the day (century) and start off with some grasshoppers?  Yes, sir!  EDC's \"chapulines\" can be prepared saut\u00e9ed either in garlic lime or habanero.  For the uninitiated, the closest thing to compare them to would be crispy shrimp tails but juicier.  The habanero order offered terrific heat and not in a painful, shoot me in the face kind of way.  At $7.50, it was a large portion that could have easily satisfied a party of six.  Not for everyone by any means, my wife was literally one and done, but I enjoyed it and had plenty to take home (fried rice, anyone?).\n\n\"Imperial Shrimp\" was everything I look for in an appetizer: seafood stuffed Pacific wild shrimp wrapped in bacon and then lightly fried. The creamy heat (sounds gross, right?) from the chipotle ranch dressing that accompanied the dish was awesome.  More things in life should be wrapped in bacon!  I should start a national campaign.\n\nWe chose to split the humungous carne asada entr\u00e9e.  The citrus marinated steak was medium rare perfection.  I loved the big slabs of grilled cactus that it came with.  We probably boxed up 70 percent of the plate.  Goddamn nachos and salsa....\n\nYou'd think that would prevent us from ordering dessert, but the flan and tres leches cake somehow made it to the table.  The latter was plated nicely and the rum flavor made me feel like I was on vacation.  It was a great end to the meal and I can't wait to try more.",

    "text": "I had three thoughts running through my head as my wife and I were walking out.\n\n1. Outfuckingstanding!!\n2. I am having this, this and this next time.\n3. We better come back soon because popularity is inevitable and I am going to dread when I'll have to wait 30+ minutes for a table.  I'll do it though.  \n\nEating at the bar was great since we were able to chat with Woosuk aka Ryan aka the owner throughout our meal.  He handles everything with Moko except for the cooking.  That's left to Chef Hong who is a goooooodddddaaaamn culinary wizard!!  That guy is a total one man show coming in at 10am daily to prep all their amazing stuff for dinner when doors open at 5pm.    \n\nJust discussing the effort and detail Hong goes into preparing plates like the delectable beef short rib (butchering the beef himself, select bones to cook with to enhance the flavor, 3+ hours of cooking etc) was inspiring.  A well presented dish, the beefy fattiness of the short rib accompanied by crispy garlic, gratin and amazing sauce was heavenly.    Christina Perri's \"A Thousand Years\" was playing while I savored it all and it seemed very fitting.  \n\nIt's not often that an Asian restaurant includes a spoon for their table setting but Ryan is smart enough to know the sauce for not only the short rib but others like their \"Black Bean Noodle\" will/need/must be scooped up out of the bowl.  It sure looks a lot more elegant than sticking my face into it.  Genius!   \n\nThey offer Berkshire pork belly cooked for either 10 or 30(!!!) hours.  Even though the 10 hour belly is tenderer, how could I pass up 20 more hours of cooking for $1 more?  It was like nothing I'd ever had before.  The soybean paste marinade with the kimchi crepe and their homemade black raspberry marinated salt (who does that???) was exceptional. \n\nThe grilled then chilled eggplant salad with micro greens and tomato was refreshing and flavorful.  We also got an order of the fried soy chicken wings which was like modern soul food with the unique breading and honey glaze.  There was absolutely nothing left but bones.  \n\nI entered Moko expecting a decent meal and left having an excellent one.  There's nothing quite like this in Vegas at the moment.  Go go go!!",

    "text": "I expected Carson Kitchen to be a little busy based on the buzz, but not a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night.  At least my wife and I were able to get drinks and hang around their outdoor area in the back.  The whole thing was quite an eye opener for me.  Who would have thought even 5 years ago that something like this would be thriving on 6th St and Carson???  Amazing!\n\nThe dining area was a little cramped but still maintained a cool vibe.  The open kitchen, bustling servers and unique seating area kind of enhanced the experience.  I wouldn't come with more than a party of 4 until their outdoor and upstairs areas are done.  Our server informed us those areas would be complete in about a week.\n\nI'd classify the fare as \"New American\".  Kerry and his staff do some really interesting twists.  Their \"Wellington Empanada\" was a delicious way to start the meal.  I enjoyed their take on the typical empanada crust.  It was light with some crunch and soaked up the excellent sauce on the plate nicely.  \n\nMy wife gasped when she saw they offered \"Crispy Chicken Skins\" and ordered it almost before our server got out the word \"hello\".  Breaded and deep fried chicken skin isn't exactly clean eating but holy shit was it awesome.  Maybe chicken skin really is the new bacon!  It was a glorious way to swiftly kick my diet right in the balls.  Both of us weren't really big on the smoked honey dipping sauce it came with and opted to use the rich empanada sauce instead.\n\nWe shared the \"Rabbit Ragu\" and the \"Cocoa-Espresso NY Strip Steak\" done rare.  The rabbit was delightful and the sauce delivered a surprisingly spicy kick.  Thankfully, the spaghetti was made of squash.  I needed some vegetables after my mini guilt trip on the chicken skins :P The steak was a little more medium rare than rare but the sauce and light espresso flavor made up for it.\n\nCan't wait to drink and dine outside next time!",

    "text": "While the people I went with were all lovely, I felt limited in what could have been ordered for reasons not worth getting into.  The service, quality of ingredients, creativity, and a yearning for a more shared experience guarantee a return visit.  Perhaps Willy Wonka and Marilyn Manson would be my dream dinner companions to get bizarre with at Bazaar.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is pretty unique.  With Jose Andres being the culinary advisor for NBC's recently cancelled TV version of \"Hannibal\", the area is a little treat for fans.  From the large blown glass above the front bar looking like long drops of blood, to all the deer heads making me feel like I was in the middle of a Will Graham hallucination, the style and vision of the show has its fingerprints all over the space.  \n\nThe beef cheek was done wonderfully.  It was the tenderest version of cow face I've ever had,  probably because of its wagyuness.  I liked how it was served like steak instead of a stew or overly saucy.  Safe to say, the distinct texture was not a hit with everyone as I alone reached for seconds and thirds.  \n\nIt's a good thing we got something a little more traditional like the chateaubriand presented already sliced.  Those big slices of rare meat were excellent.  Maybe it was just me feeling \"Hannibalistic\" at the moment, but the corn feed flavor and iron taste of the tenderloin really popped.  \n\nUnbelievably to me, the 2 pound grilled Maine lobster was the best dish we had.  Whatever the crack sauce was that the cook put on top took my taste buds into overdrive.  The head of the lobster was an absolute delight.  The tomalley (aka the uni of the lobster) mixed with the sauce and that awesome grill flavor was one of the best things I've had in recent memory.  My Asianess begged me to order a bowl of white rice to mix it all with, but I ended up diving straight into it with two hands until there was nothing left to gnaw on.  Who needs a damn bib?\n\nSo is it worth it?  If the plan is to get a ribeye and potatoes, I would go to Carnevino over this.  But there are a fair amount of menu items that are intriguing, especially the whole pig, that could make this a really fun and interesting dining experience.  I'll be back before SLS falls to pieces.",

    "text": "Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....\n\nI was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their \"Tonkotsu Assari\" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.  \n\nIt's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.  \n\nTo my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!  \n\nGood call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P",

    "text": "Another cool spot open on the outskirts (for now) of Fremont.  I like the modern, neighborhood vibe and it looks like the menu will change often enough to try something different on every visit.\n\nThe sweet potato salad, or as I call it \"mouthfuls of autumn\", was delicious.  Their red snapper was the best piece of cooked fish I'd had in recent memory.  And their vanilla meringue pie, which was apparently a one time thing as they change their desserts daily, was a nice ending.               \n\n3 stars?\n\n- I hate being picky over stuff like this.  While the seared ahi tuna entr\u00e9e was very tasty, we only got 4 pieces of it.  Every other picture shows 6-7 pieces.  Tazeen A's photo looked like she got the whole damn fish. \n\n- White wine served at room temperature.    \n\n- The fact they ask how much I want to tip after ordering everything at the cashier.  Yeah, it was a pleasant couple of minutes interacting with the staff while picking what to order, but I shouldn't be obligated to tip a minimum of 18% based on that.  I'll tip when I am ready to leave.  Would they consider a wait staff for dinner?  The employees come over often enough during the meal to refill water, clear plates, and ask how everything is anyways.    \n\nThere's no doubt I'll be back for breakfast or lunch.  I imagine the large windows make the place look terrific during daylight hours.  I also look forward to taking advantage of the caffeine treats their award winning barista doles out.",

    "text": "With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. \n\nLike a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  \n\nI can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P\n\nThe Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  \n\nOur meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!\n\nThe lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the \"European Sea Bass\" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!  \n\nLesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time.",

    "text": "Middle Eastern food on the strip!  SLS players club offered $30 off of $60 during my birthday month so that made it a clear choice on a recent Monday night.  It was packed at 8:30pm with quite a few people waiting outside.  I'd suggest making a reservation.  Being the middle ground between casual eateries at the resort (Umami) and high end (Bazaar Meat) makes it easy to see why Cleo is so popular.\n\nThe menu offered a lot to ponder over, but my mind was already set on one thing....falafel!  It's not easy to find a good version of those deep fried balls of chickpea/fava bean heaven around these parts, but the ones they're serving up here are falawesome.  The light crunch of the exterior went into delicious, warm legume center that was well spiced.  My only regret was not ordering the side of hummus since the amount that arrived with the plate wasn't even enough for three balls let alone seven.  \n\nA minor complaint was that while six of the balls were dark green on the inside, one was very pale green.  It didn't taste much different...still... can you imagine if Robert DeNiro's character from the film \"Casino\" saw this?  He would have ripped the chef a new one and then made sure he personally saw to every falafel that came out of the kitchen!  \n\n\"Kibbeh Nayyeh\": chopped raw lamb accompanied with mint, bulgar and lebaneh, was my wife's favorite dish.  It was unlike any other tartare I'd ever had.  The creaminess of the lebaneh (Lebanese yogurt cheese) blended so well with the meat and the toasted parmesan crackers to spread it on.\n\nI found the shawarma portion to be very small for $8 and would definitely pay more for a full lamb entr\u00e9e or just get kebabs instead.  The moussaka was below average and we didn't even bother finishing it before ordering the impressively rich and decadent sticky toffee dessert.  \n\nThere are plenty of other menu items worth checking out on a repeat visit like grilled octopus, flatbreads, and multiple mezzes.  I don't plan on being a stranger.",

    "text": "Prior to dining, my only familiarity with the Katsuya name was from TMZ.  If I were making half a milly per TV episode, this would be in my regular dining rotation too!  The menu's prices are on par with Nobu, Sushi Roku or Blue Ribbon.  \n\nAt least those restaurants offer some kind of a chic atmosphere.  Katsuya felt like an upscale diner with a sushi bar plunked in the middle.  The bright lighting, noise from the casino and the constant yelling of \"Irashaimase!\" over and over and over by employees made this a decisively unsexy spot.  I can't imagine tourists would want this kind of setting for a pricey sushi meal on the strip.  If a booth at Nobu's outpost at Caesars Palace is Kate Upton, it's kind of Rosie O'Donnell here.  Power lunches or corporate dinners? Yes.  Anniversary dinners or bachelorette parties? No!  \n\nFor those reasons, my wife and I chose to sit at the bar since the people working there looked like they were having a good time.  All them were super nice and knowledgeable of all things Katsuya. They also made some awesome cocktails to boot.  I loved the \"Sahara Cooler\" which consisted of Ketel One Oranje vodka, Aperol, passion-fruit pur\u00e9e, fresh lime juice, and Stiegl Radler Grapefruit beer.  That was instant refreshment.  One of the bartenders, whose name escapes me but I remember being a Chargers/Eagles fan, created a wonderful version of a prickly pear cocktail for my wife. \n\nThe plan was to not order items we could get at local, off the strip Japanese spots like Kyara or Raku.  So $8 edamame (shockingly saw lots of people order this), anything from the robata grill ($12 for asparagus with no bacon) and $11 karaage were out of the question.  \n\nWant to know what was?  Rare Wagyu filet with foie gras on top!  So tender and soooo decadent, it was like a story I never wanted to end.  The plum wine sauce reduction really added a nice balance.  Lobster and truffle chawanmushi was another dish I don't see everyday.  Despite the small portion being steamed in a Japanese tea cup, I thought it tasted great and would probably order it again.  Dig in from the bottom for maximum truffle taste.\n\nI thought the Wagyu sashimi seared with hot oil and topped with chives and ginger was very good too.  The oil they used made it taste more like a Chinese dish which was a nice little changeup from the other beef dish.  Seared tuna with Japanese salsa was equally as good.  The high quality of the fish was easy to see as well as taste.\n\nMy wife was still hungry and had her eye on the \"Wafu Carbonara\" which was simply described as \"slow-cooked bacon, soy reduction, and soft poached egg\".  I tried to talk her out of it since she makes a great version of this dish at home.  Unsurprisingly, I lost that battle.  One of the bartenders assured us this was something worth having and she was right.  The huge chunks of pork belly with bonito flakes and sauce/egg mix just oozing over the ramen noodles was a hearty dish and a nice ending to the meal.",

It would definitely work out for the kind of people that order only California rolls at sushi joints.          \n\nOur friendly, upbeat hostess gave us a window seat, \"for the romance\", although the outstanding view of a Toyota minivan in need of a wash and hungry CES attendees walking by didn't quite capture that feeling.  Maybe a Yelp quick tip like \"don't propose here\" is needed. \n\nAll jokes aside, the two of us were ravenous and came specifically for their \"bottomless curry\".  We were also eating vegetarian this evening and found only 2 choices of curry disappointing.  I went with the \"Dal Tadka\" for a solid dinner price of $10, which was basically a fancy lentil soup.  It was hearty (as much as lentils can be anyway) with nice mix of curryness and heat.  Since only the curry itself was unlimited, I did my best to conserve the naan ($3 for another) and basmati rice ($5).  For $8, I would have rather tried one of their interesting looking tapas.  It also took around 5 minutes (sometimes longer) for the next bowl of curry to come out.  I could see this taking even more time when busy, so that could potentially be a problem.  I was without carbs by my fourth bowl.  The waiter also informed me that I had broken the bowl record.   \n\nMy wife got the \"Palak Paneer Masala\".  That had decent flavor, but it was too soupy for my taste.  I would have preferred a standard saag paneer at any average Indian restaurant over this.                      \n\nDespite all this, I remain optimistic for future visits.  They have a full bar area with happy hour.  I can't think of another Indian spot that has a bar worth hanging out at.  Perhaps bringing more people and trying all the \"Bombay Bites\" would be a better way to go. \n\n2.874937278209019221 stars.  Round up!",

    "text": "This spot definitely challenges the general assumption that vegans eat twigs and grass all day.  The comfort food aspect shines and really sets it apart from others.  Herbivores or anyone like me that occasionally swings that way should add Violette's Vegan to what has grown into a decent rotation of meatless meals around town.  I didn't have an great dinner, but I think that's on me and my poor decisions.    \n\n \"Red Rock Nachos\":  Waitress recommended.  While plentiful and filling, the vegan cheese sauce was the biggest difference between this version and a typical plate at a video poker bar and it was just OK.  Perhaps melted shredded vegan cheese would have been a superior alternative.  \n\n\"Mama Mia\": The eggplant parmesan was better than I thought it would be.  The breading was delicious with the plant based mozzarella substitute being surprisingly good.  The only minus was the flimsy, overdone pasta.  I have NO clue what came over me in ordering this entr\u00e9e. I could've had this at any great Italian eatery!!!  Did I check my brain at the door??  Total choke job by me.  Rarely happens.  Figures I do it in a vegan joint of all places!!  Ha!  \n\n \"Shangri La Sunset\":  My wife's choice only because they didn't have the rice bowl she wanted.  Seitan chicken stir-fried with vegetables was a decent, healthy dish, but it just had me longing for another veggie place on Spring Mountain.  I grounded out, she flew out.  \n\nIn the end, I misclicked this whole experience and wished to press the reset button.  We plan on getting the Hungry Man, Samurai Burger, Bubba Ke Bubba and falafel next time.  Hoping to go back soon and right my wrongs.",

    "text": "While the food and service were pretty good, my biggest issue was with the bar/counter setup.  All the great shabu shabu meals I've ever had consist of a group of 4+ sitting around one big pot while chatting, swishing, and drinking away.  Here?  If I want to kanpai it up (they say liquor is coming soon) with the fourth person in the party, I have to get up out of my seat, walk 3 chairs down to clink glasses and shoot.  Then stand awkwardly making small talk for 20 seconds before walking back.  That's pretty lame.  \n\nIt may just be a cultural thing.  Three American dudes probably don't want to share a pot, thus this singular experience.  It's easy to see the powers that be put a lot of time and effort into making Yojie look and run as well as it does, but I'd rather order matzo ball soup and a pastrami sandwich in this setting.\n\nAlso:\n\n- The atypical tonkotsu broth goes best with pork or maaaybe chicken.  Beef doesn't work.  \n- Cherry blossom tea was terrific.\n- Trust me and at least get the samurai size.  My wife crushed this serving and was ready for more.  \n- Since shabu shabu is generally a winter meal, they definitely make the room cold enough to feel that way.  Bring a jacket.  \n\nThey have plans to open up more locations in Vegas, so count on me as a regular at one of the others that are group friendly.",

Oysters were mandatory and a great way to start the meal.  They featured 3 types (Fanny Bay, Bluepoint. Skookum) and while I could only tell which was which based on shell, they all went down the same way, deliciously.  The pickled peppers/habanero and wasabi cocktail sauces were my favorites.  Most spots only offer $1-$2 oysters for happy hour, but just like Lionel Richie, these guys are doing it \"All Night Long\", one of many reasons to be a repeat customer.   \n\nThe \"Caviar & French Toast\" with the cr\u00e8me fraiche was a nice little curveball to the palette.  The toast's warm, buttery softness went nicely with the rest and we even got more of it just to finish the order.  Other standouts were the \"Grilled Shrimp Salad\" with its excellent dressing and soba noodles, and the \"White Fish Ceviche\", which I was selfishly eating straight out of the jar by the end.  \n\nA little piece of seafood heaven on the westside for sure.  I could envision myself overlooking the beach while eating their delectable ocean treats.  Luckily for everyone in Vegas, Other Mama is here, and hopefully will be for a long time.",

    "text": "Only having 15 generally average Yelp reviews over two years in the middle of one of the most foodcentric plazas in town did not help the previous management in what was formerly known as \"Korean Delicious\".  So it comes as no surprise that new people have come in, made a significant facelift in d\u00e9cor, and dole out some decent AYCE KBBQ at a nice bargain price of $20.\n\nThis is still very run of the mill.  You go in, expect to be brought multiple plates of banchan, and assume staple items like kalbi, pork belly and bulgogi are good.  Check, check.  There's certainly nothing wrong with that.  Beef tongue missing from the menu was a little disappointing, flank steak was dry (blame the cook?), but there is plenty else to load up on.\n\nIf I could do it over, I would have gone with half orders of the meat so we could have tried other offerings like small octopus, baby back ribs, Hwaro pork belly (thin sliced) and even pork skin.  Airing old school Mazinger Z shows on the television made for a nice bonus.  \n\nThey will most likely have to depend on the overflow of neighboring restaurants to survive in a square full of Vegas stalwarts (Raku, Monta, Kabuto etc).  That might prove to be enough since the parking lot is packed to the gills on many evenings.",

    "text": "The truckload of food that Takashi pushes out for his $40 twelve course dinners make Restaurant Week look like Restaurant Weak.  Seriously... you would need to attach a garbage disposal to your stomach to make it through this bad boy.  Maybe if my car broke down up on Mount Charleston and I walked all the way here would it be possible?  So while value, ambition, friendly service, and remarkable design upgrades cannot be denied, my fault is with the execution and general flow of the menu.  Even for myself, I find it hard to believe I am complaining about too much food, but I am going there.   \n\nAs an example, course plate #4-#8 could easily go chicken teriyaki, huge sushi roll, 6 oysters, karaage (fried chicken) and then beef sukiyaki.  That's like a mixtape going from Mozart to Slipknot to Whitney Houston to last year's Grammy winning polka artist.  Why are oysters right in the dead center of the 12?  Who goes from fried meat to sukiyaki in real life?  \n\nSomething like this should be harmonious from beginning to end, but I just looked at it as battles within battles.  The menu vs my stomach capacity, the food vs the ever-growing takeout bag the servers kept loading up, my waistline vs my pants, my tastebuds' sanity vs \"holy shit, we're only on #5??\"  A server informed us that only one person had been able to plow through it all since they opened and that \"He was a Yelper\".  Nice job, Yelper.  Did you go to Home Depot or Lowe's for that attachment? ;)\n\nIf you're still going to do this, these are the battles between course choices:\n\n#3: Soba Salad vs Tofu Salad vs Potato Salad: My wife's Soba Salad won.  The dressing mixed with the cold noodles and crisp greens were excellent.  You also get a choice of salad topping (grilled salmon, chicken or salmon skin).  We both went with grilled salmon although perhaps the salmon skin might have come off like a luxurious crouton and been the way to go.  Don't load up on potato!  Trust me.  \n\n#6: Oysters vs Snow Crab: It was a TKO by the oysters.   Even though the crab was nicely presented on a chilled plate, it could never be a match of 6 large raw oysters on a wooden boat.  This would retail for at least $18 elsewhere.  I will be back for this the next time dining a la carte.  \n \n#7: Tempura vs Karaage: We barely touched either of these due to fullness and what was still to come, but I'd go with the tempura which was a nice medley of veggies along with 2 pieces of shrimp.  Even though the karaage was dry and uninspiring, it lasted better in the fridge whereas tempura should be eaten immediately and was really bad a couple of days later.  \n\nAlready stuffed to the gills, it was at this point that we considered asking to return tomorrow to finish the rest.  Would it be OK if I just left my credit card overnight?  I saw that there was a foot spa in the same plaza.  Maybe we could come back in an hour?  That moment sounded as good a time as any to take up cigarette smoking.  \n\n#8: Beef Sukiyaki vs Diced Steak:  Bitch, please.  Not only did the steak not put up a fight, they didn't even walk into the ring.  Flawless victory!  The sukiyaki was classic.  It was rich and filled with noodles, vegetables and semi-fatty beef which made the broth even better.  We asked for a side of raw egg to dip the beef into, and that made those 6 combined bites we took before they whisked it away in takeout boxes even better.  This could have been a standalone entr\u00e9e.  \n\n#9: Mini Doria vs 4 pc Baked Fantasy:  They should get rid of this course altogether.  The doria is a bowl of rice topped with a mix of ground beef, tomato sauce and cream.  No one in their right mind would want this after everything else.  Ditto for a gross hot sushi roll filled with cream cheese.  Lose, lose. \n \nServer: \"Anything else?\"\nMe: \"Lap band surgery.\"\n\n#10: 4 piece nigiri vs Salmon Bowl (more rice!) vs Hamburger:  Nigiri won.  It was the smallest portion of food!  Tony T was at another table and got the hamburger which was a FULL HAMBURGER, BUN AND ALL WITH FRIES.  Am I going crazy?  \n\nSome may avoid this spot because their AYCE is $80 per person, but with the exorbitant amount of food we walked out with, it'll be more about all you can't eat.  There were 5 more individual meals with the leftovers we had!  Portions should be halved, if not quartered, and everything needs to be rearranged by someone with sane eyes.   No one would complain about paying $40 for that.",

    "text": "It won't take a psychic to see more Indian dinners in my future now that there's a quality spot around these parts.\n\nI was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside \"spot\" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.\n\nMy wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish \"hot\" which wasn't over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   \n\nThe $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion, so if I really wanted Chana Masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entr\u00e9e.  We went with the Baingan Bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.\n\nI am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "When comparing the hot triple threat of New American eats in DTLV, Therapy reluctantly gets the bronze medal by a few tenths of a point.  It's still worthy, offering things the others don't, like cozier seating, a nice sized bar, and the only place on the block with big TV's for sports.  But despite a few interesting menu twists, their dishes either match similarly in quality to their competitors or fall a bit short, but never really surpass.         \n\nThe \"Crispy Fried Pig Ears\" are presented like a bride's bouquet at a high end redneck wedding.  This group friendly dish came a lot crispier with less breading on my most recent visit, which I felt to be not as good as my initial time; it still magically disappeared though.  The truffle honey mustard dipping sauce is kind of gross, so I just eat them straight, preferably with a large glass of Hamm's.  \n\nAnother great partner with beer is \"Popcorn\".  The fried peanuts and maple candied bacon make for wonderful companions, but sharing this with actual companions is slightly awkward since you'll basically be eating bits that were touched, but unsuccessfully attempted to be picked up, by others when diving in for their handful.  I wanted chopsticks!  A bigger bowl with a mini shovel would work better.  I'd like a couple of hits of whatever the chef was smoking when he thought of this one.   \n\nThe \"Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Slider\" is an eye catcher with all its color, but a crispier waffle would have made for a functional sandwich instead of sloppiness on a plate.  The fried chicken itself was crispy and very juicy.  I would have been down with just a bucket of that.  Definitely worth returning for, but I'll be eating this all deconstructed with a fork and knife next time.\n\nOne dish to be avoided is the \"Roasted Cauliflower\".  The extreme char masked any signs of seasoning.  That place on Carson that starts with a \"G\" does an incredible version of this.  Get the excellent \"Street Corn\" instead or save the extra bucks (and room) for one of Therapy's great desserts like carrot cake or smores.  \n\n3.7623235799213 stars.",

    "text": "Someone once said \"No one chooses to go to Denny's, they just end up there.\"  I somehow ended up at a restaurant serving raw vegan.  Hey!  They don't have to cook any of it!  This should come out quick! haaaaa\n\nWhen I used to live in NYC, there was a semi well known \"Juice Bar\" on St Mark's for a while that was a front for selling illegal things.  Walking into this pretty empty space totally reminded me of that.  Aside from the salad bar in the center of the relatively big room, one would be hard pressed to tell if the restaurant was coming or going.  There was a sushi display case at the rear counter from probably like 4 businesses ago and a bar on the right that looked like it hadn't seen a patron in years.  With its basement type ambiance, Go Vegan Caf\u00e9 is clearly a takeout type eatery.  I doubt a person that lives this type of lifestyle cares about any of that since a lack of vegan options in the neighborhood would totally supersede atmosphere.\n\nThe \"Raw Portobello Burger\" with its nut patty (made with almonds, sunflower seeds, sun-dried tomatoes, ginger, & carrots) was better than expected.  The creaminess of the almond \"cheese\" and avocado made for a more than passable garden sandwich.  The onion rawtilla bun wasn't flimsy at all and held everything together nicely.  The \"fries\" were simply 3 slices of breaded avocado hmmmm. My wife liked her \"Veggie Wrap\" which was basically a reshaped salad as collard greens were used as the tortilla.  The house slaw that came with her dish with its unique dressing was the tastiest thing we had.  \n\nTwo dishes and veggie juice came out to $37, yet both of us were still hungry later.  Wanting to stay consistent with the whole raw evening, I ate a couple of bananas later on.  There's really no rush for me to return, but if I find myself on one of those beefx5 kind of weeks, this would be a good way to change up the eating cycle.",

Yes, and please keep them coming.  \nBottom sirloin?  Heck yes!  I'll take 3 slices.  \nLamb chops?  OH FUCK YES!!  Leave the whole freakin thing on the table!!!  \n\nNo....control.....whatsoever.  If a shady looking dude wearing a hat and a musty  overcoat offered candy corn straight from the palm of his slightly dirty hand, I would say yes and assume it was a limited time promotion.  \n\nFogo de Chao vs Texas de Brazil:  It's a high scoring draw. Sure, there a few items the other one doesn't have, and certain meats may be slightly better at one over the other, but everyone ends up a winner in this fight no matter which you choose.",
